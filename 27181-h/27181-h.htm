<h2>Translators Preface.</h2>


<p>Consumption is curable. From time to time the news of
some great discovery rushes over the land like a mighty wave;
but never before has the intelligence of a great achievement
been received with such universal delight. There is hardly a
man, woman or child that does not bewail the loss of some
dear relative taken away by Tuberculosis, the most terrible of
all foes. More terrible because it stealthily creeps into the
system and takes a firm hold before its presence can even be
surmised.</p>

<p>Now the appearance of a deliverer is hailed as would the
advent of the Messiah. Koch, formerly a poor and obscure
student, being especially interested in bacteriology has plodded
and worked for years. Even in the year 1882 he has made
known to the world the evil spirit in describing the tubercle-bacillus
as the specific generator of tuberculosis. We then
knew the enemy but had no weapon to fight him. Now Koch
has also manufactured the sword with which to combat the
evil genius. The experimental tests thus far have not tended
to lessen the merits of Koch's remedy. Added applications
have resulted in additional success. The investigations are
not yet complete; only meager particulars have thus far been
given to the public from authorized sources. To guard against
misleading representations the translator has undertaken to
give to the American public only what has actually been
achieved. He felt himself called upon to do this not only
because he has followed the progress of Koch's labors with
the keenest interest, but also because he himself has worked
and labored on this field for many years.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>Justly has a vast excitement taken hold of all
classes of the people, an excitement that has
caused all other contemporary events to fall back.
The search for an actual remedy for that exceedingly
ravaging disease, tuberculosis, has at last been
crowned with success, and even the most uneducated
will be able to estimate the significance of this event.</p>

<p>We need but consider, that pulmonary consumption,
the most frequent form of tuberculosis, annually
demands over 30,000 victims in the cities of the
German Empire over 15,000 inhabitants, and out
of every 100 deceased 12&ndash;13 have fallen prey to
this sickness.</p>

<p>The number of sufferers from pulmonary consumption
can not nearly be determined, it certainly
exceeds all other diseases by far. In the case of
many people we can only infer from their appearance
and hereditary tendencies, before visible signs can be
discovered, that they will succumb to this terrible
disease.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>And this disease is now curable. Millions of
people who have considered themselves doomed, will
be given back to life; their regained strength will
greatly increase the national wealth. In short, we
look forward to an era, such as was not dreamt of
even by the most vivid imagination only a few years
back. But rather than be carried too far by our
enthusiasm, let us study Koch's new method to cure,
as far as we are now enabled to pass judgement
on it.</p>

<p>First of all we must explain: <i>What is tuberculosis?
What relation does it bear to pulmonary
consumption?</i></p>

<p>Pulmonary consumption is only one form of
tuberculosis, by far the most frequent. This is
the reason why pulmonary consumption, pulmonary
tuberculosis, consumption and tuberculosis are used
as <i>synonymous</i> terms.</p>

<p>Tuberculosis is the <i>general</i> expression. By that
we understand a disease which is generated by a
certain kind of organism belonging to the class of
bacteria. These organisms are the tubercle bacilli,
which were discovered by Koch in the year 1882.</p>

<p>Now these tubercle bacilli settle most frequently
in the lungs and here cause serious derangements
of the lung tissue. <i>Pulmonary consumption</i> is
the result.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>But the tubercle bacilli will also settle in any
other portions of the body and cause tuberculosis.</p>

<p>Frequently the tubercle bacilli nestle in the
<i>larynx</i> and the result is <i>laryngeal consumption</i>.</p>

<p>They may infect the mucous lining of the tongue
and nasal passages and cause the rarely occurring
diseases&mdash;<i>tuberculosis of the tongue and nose</i>.</p>

<p>More frequently tuberculosis of the intestines
results, the well-known <i>intestinal consumption</i>.</p>

<p>The spreading of tuberculosis in the brain is of
especial importance on account of the importance of
this organ. Very frequently small children are
attacked by <i>tuberculosis</i> of the <i>cerebral membranes</i>,
a disease that has heretofore unexceptionally resulted
in <i>death</i>.</p>

<p>Much oftener than is generally supposed the
<i>kidneys</i> are the seat of tuberculosis; and also the
<i>suprarenal capsules</i>, whose functions are as yet
entirely unknown, have in postmortem examinations
been found to be tubercularly degenerated.</p>

<p>In the diseases of the <i>bones</i> and <i>joints</i> tuberculosis
forms an important part. Those infinitely small
and weak tubercle-bacilli have the power to destroy
the hard and firm substance of the bones, to soften
it and change it to pus. Whole portions of bone may
disappear in this way.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>Tuberculosis can also destroy parts of the <i>skin</i>.
In this case it is called <i>Lupus</i>.</p>

<p>Finally tuberculosis is found in the <i>generative
organs</i>. Tubercular derangements are frequently
met with in the <i>testicles</i> of men, less often in the
<i>ovaries</i> of women.</p>

<p>The well known children's disease <i>Scrofula</i> is
considered a preceding stage of tuberculosis by many
physicians. This much is certain that Scrofula
inclines to tuberculosis.</p>

<p>Let us study the several forms of tuberculosis
after this general synopsis; we will begin with pulmonary
consumption.</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="Pulmonary_Consumption" id="Pulmonary_Consumption"></a>Pulmonary Consumption.</h2>

<p>Even before the discovery of the tubercle-bacillus
by Koch, different scientists had claimed that
pulmonary consumption was caused by the immigration
of bacteria into the lungs, and several of them
had found bacteria of that kind. But it remained
for Koch to bring light upon the conjectures of other
scientists, and he established the fact, that the
bacillus discovered by him was the real generator of
pulmonary consumption. Millions of these bacilli
exist in the lungs of the diseased, and millions of
them are thrown out with the sputum.</p>

<p>If we take a very small quantity of this thrown
out matter and examine it with a microscope, we
will find a greater or smaller number of these
tubercle bacilli. Of course the preparation to be
microscopically examined must previously be colored
with some coloring matter, otherwise it is very
difficult, well nigh impossible, to detect the infinitely
small bacilli. The method of coloring now generally
in use consists in discoloring the preparation after
the coloring has been completed, it is found that the
bacilli tenaciously cling to the coloring matter, and
in this way it is easy to recognize the tubercle-bacilli
under the microscope.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>These bacilli are infinitely minute, they are <small><sup>2</sup></small>&frasl;<small><sub>1000</sub></small>
to <small><sup>8</sup></small>&frasl;<small><sub>1000</sub></small> millimeters long, and about <small><sup>5</sup></small>&frasl;<small><sub>100000</sub></small> millimeters
in width. Therefore it is absolutely impossible to
recognize them with the naked eye. Generally they
are somewhat bent, sometimes slightly nicked at one
end.</p>

<p>The temperature of boiling water destroys the
vitality of the bacilli under all circumstances. Even a
temperature of 70&deg;&nbsp;C. is able to lessen the efficacy of
the bacilli. Unhappily this temperature is too high
to be applied against the tubercle-bacilli in the
human body without causing the most serious injury
to it. Nevertheless it has been tried, we will speak of
this later on.</p>

<p>Then the drugs that kill the bacteria, such as
Carbolic Acid, Alcohol, Iodoformether, Ether, Sublimate,
Thymol, destroy the tubercle-bacilli so slowly
and only in such high concentrations that their
application is impossible without endangering the
patient. Therefore the prospects of directly destroying
the bacilli in the human body had to be given up
as impossible.</p>

<p>We are now confronted with two questions:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. In what manner does the tubercle-bacillus enter into the human
organism?</p>

<p>2. Under what conditions is the tubercle-bacillus able to generate
pulmonary consumption after it has entered the human organism?</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>All investigations, both of earlier and later date
have established the fact that the tubercle-bacillus
is inhaled with the air, and then it is mainly the foul
air which is accused. But foul air is especially found
in such places where people congregate, as in rooms,
barracks, factories, etc. As it is a fact that there are
always several consumptives among a number of
people, so in this case there will always be occasion
to inhale the tubercle-bacilli that have been cast out
by the consumptives. Therefore it is not the foul air
in itself which generates pulmonary consumption,
but the circumstance that in this connection there
are always people present which are able to spread
and scatter the bacilli.</p>

<p>Luckily the physical qualities of the tubercle-bacilli
are such that they mostly adhere to the
ground or floor and are rarely scattered in the air as
dust; otherwise pulmonary consumption would be
much more frequent than it is at present. Unfortunately
the bacilli are very often spread through
uncleanliness of the people, because they touch objects
with their fingers to which the tubercle-bacilli
chance to stick and then they touch their mouth or
nose with these fingers. In this way bacilli can be
taken into the system especially easily with the food.
Children are particularly exposed to contamination,
crawling about on the ground, on which, perhaps
but recently, a consumptive has spit, and more so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
because they often have the habit to put all sorts of
things and also the generally dirty fingers into
their mouth.</p>

<p>On the other hand there are various obstacles in
the way of tubercle-bacilli entering the lungs. The
distance from the mouth to the lungs is long and
narrow; all sorts of projections check the further
penetration of the bacilli. The trachea and the air-passages
of the lungs possess equipments arranged
for the purpose of ejecting small foreign substances,
thus also to throw out the bacilli. In short it is not
too easy a matter for the bacilli to penetrate into
the lungs.</p>

<p>And yet this happens only too often. For
instance, in some people the passage from the mouth
down may be a wide one, so that the bacilli can
enter more easily; the protective arrangement by
which foreign substances are removed may be deranged,
it may be wanting in some place or its
functionary qualifications may be bad; especially
frequent this is the case after enfeebling diseases,
which are associated with severe cough, as measles,
whooping-cough, etc. This is the reason why pulmonary
consumption is strikingly often observed to
follow just these diseases.</p>

<p>But the tubercle-bacillus can also enter the body
with the food, as stated before. The acid gastric
juice is a protective agent which considerably lessens
the danger of infection by tuberculosis.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>It has not been definitely decided at the present
time whether the drinking of milk from tuberculous
cows brings with it the danger of tuberculosis for
mankind. It will certainly be best to avoid such
milk, especially when the cow's udder is found to be
tuberculously diseased or when tubercle-bacilli can be
traced in the milk.</p>

<p>The use of meat as food may also become
dangerous to man, but this is a rare occurrence. It
is particularly dangerous to eat the liver, kidneys
and lymphatic glands of tuberculous animals. The
boiling heat while cooking generally destroys the
bacilli contained therein and so lessens the danger
from this source. It is of no little importance, to
call particular attention to the fact that our chickens
are very often severely infected with tuberculosis.</p>

<p>The question, whether a consumptive can <i>infect
his surroundings</i>, may be answered thus, that this
does <i>not</i> happen as a rule. Several unhappy circumstances
must come together to make this possible.
Above all things a direct transmission of tubercle-bacilli
in some way into the body of the healthy
person, then the bacilli must cling and propagate in
the same, which is only possible when there is an inclination
to this disease, of course this inclination is
quite common.</p>

<p>Pulmonary consumption is <i>not hereditary</i> in the
strict sense of the word. Only an inclination to this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
disease is transmitted. As the danger of contagion
of those having such disposition is very great, so as
a rule the disease makes its appearance sooner or
later.</p>

<p>On the other hand it must be considered that the
penetration <i>only</i> of the tubercle-bacilli into the
body is <i>not</i> sufficient to generate tuberculosis. If
they do not find the ground adapted to their nourishment
and propagation they perish. It may be
assumed that every person is placed in such circumstances
at some time that he will take in tubercle-bacilli;
but only a certain percentage will get consumption.
In the remainder the bacilli perish
without leaving even a trace.</p>

<p>Very often the inclination to pulmonary consumption
may be recognized from the external
characteristics. As a rule the respective individuals
have a slight body, thin lean skin, weak muscles,
delicate skeleton, a long, narrow, flat chest, flattening
of the regions over and below the shoulderblades,
wide intercostal spaces, a winglike projecting of the
scapul&aelig;, long neck, clubby, knoblike appearance of
the ends of the fingers.</p>

<p>Furthermore it has been found, that pulmonary
consumptives on an average have a <i>smaller heart</i>
than is essential to a healthy body. On the other
hand the volume of the lungs of consumptives is very
often abnormally large.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>There are a large number of <i>diseases</i> that predispose
to pulmonary consumption. It is mainly the
<i>enfeebling</i> action of the same, which brings about
such results. For this reason the <i>chronic</i> diseases
contribute so much toward the multiplication of the
number of consumptives, because they stipulate a
continuous weakening of the organism and an emaciation
of the system. To these belong Bright's
disease, which very often turns into pulmonary consumption,
greensickness or chlorosis, anaemia, continued
febrile diseases, severe chronic suppuration,
chronic catarrh of the stomach, frequent pregnancies,
childbed diseases. Thus we may often see young
chlorotic girls afflicted with consumption, especially
when they marry young and enjoy the honeymoon
to its utmost limits. Then also women will easily
become consumptive when they give birth to a child
every year, especially when the social conditions in
which they live are of an unfavorable nature, and
they are perhaps inclined to consumption already.
Childbed on the whole inclines to arousing the
dormant inclination toward pulmonary consumption.</p>

<p>Of other diseases we have mentioned measles and
whooping cough, as diseases that are only too easily
succeeded by consumption. To these may be added
typhus, especially when it is of a more protracted
nature, and the reconvalescence is slow and incomplete.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>Furthermore all those workmen that have to do
with dust, are exposed to the danger of being stricken
with pulmonary consumption. The dust enters the
lungs, irritates and injures the same and so produces
a favorable soil for any tubercle bacilli that may
happen to penetrate. On the whole metal dust is
more injurious than mineral dust. Workmen, that
are exposed to animal dust, as furriers, saddlers,
brushmakers, fall prey to consumption much oftener
than those, that fulfill their vocation in air pregnant
with vegetable dust. According to statistics workingmen
are stricken with pulmonary consumption as
follows: of glass workers 80 per cent., needle grinders
70, filemakers 62, stone cutters 40, mill grinders,
lithographers, cigarmakers, brushmakers, stone-polishers
40&ndash;50, millers 10, coal workers 1 per cent.</p>

<p>Pneumonia may culminate in pulmonary consumption:
but on the whole this rarely happens.
Much oftener it is the case with Pleurisy. But it is
assumed and rightly, that most people who are
attacked by pleurisy, are already consumptive.</p>

<p>A hemorrhage of the lungs may nearly always be
considered a sure sign that consumption has taken
hold of the respective individual; but such a hemorrhage
certainly forms considerable danger to falling
a victim to tuberculosis, if the individual is as yet
free from the same.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>Age has a particularly decided influence on the
origin of consumption; it is extremely rare before
the third or fourth year, from that to the seventh it
is more frequent; it most frequently occurs in the
age from the fifteenth to the thirtieth year, and from
there on the chances are again fewer. In very old
age it is again very rare.</p>

<p>There seems to be no essential difference as
regards sex.</p>

<p><i>Insufficient</i> or <i>defective nourishment</i> acts as a
promoter in various ways. Even the nourishing of
infants with poor milk, with bread or flour-pap
increases the disposition to pulmonary consumption.
If this defective nourishment is continued, scrofula
will surely follow and this is a stage antecedent to
consumption.</p>

<p>Pulmonary consumption is relatively more
frequent among the <i>poorer</i> than the <i>well to do
people</i>, this is partly due to the meagre and scanty
food of the poorer, and that they are obliged to
subsist almost exclusively on vegetable diet. The
higher the meat prices rise and the less the majority
of the people can afford to procure meat, the larger
will be the number of consumptives. The poorly
nourished offer a good soil for the tubercle bacilli
in consequence of their weakness. The tissue offers
little or no resistance to the growth of the bacilli,
these propagate and destroy the powerless and
yielding organism with fearful rapidity.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>The <i>frequency</i> of pulmonary consumption increases
with the <i>size of the cities</i>, or, which is the
same, with the number of proletarians. Extreme
hunger and want are less frequent in the country
than in the city.</p>

<p>That the climate has an important influence on
the appearance of pulmonary consumption has long
been known. In certain elevated regions this disease
seldom or never appears. This experience has been
attained in Switzerland and many other mountain
regions. Furthermore the Plateaux of Peru and
Mexico are considered free from consumption, but
also lowlands like Iceland, the Kirgheez steppes and
the interior of Egypt are known to be exempt.</p>

<p><i>Damp and windy climate</i>, especially with very
high temperature, or abrupt changes in the temperature
promotes consumption; on the other hand it
is less frequent in the more moderated climates,
especially if they are dry.</p>

<p>Now when the tubercle bacilli have settled in the
lungs, they cause various symptoms. One of the
most frequent is <i>cough</i>. In the beginning of the disease
a short, clear but light, very often dry cough appears.
During the further development of pulmonary
consumption the cough becomes more periodic; it
appears early after awaking, in the afternoon after
dinner, and evenings at lying down; it may disappear
entirely in the meantime or may be light only;
but then as a rule it is no longer dry, but may be
attended by expectorations of a varied nature.</p>

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>The tubercle bacilli destroy the lung tissue and
change it into pus, which is coughed out. In this
way larger and smaller cavities are formed in the
lungs; finally the cavities may even take more space
than the remaining lung tissue. When cavities have
already been formed, coughing comes easy and with
abundant expectoration. Toward the end of life the
coughing and spitting stops as a result of the extreme
feebleness and weakness.</p>

<p>The violence and frequency of the cough depends
mainly whether the larger bronchial tubes and the
trachea are affected; the more this is the case, the
more violent the inclination to cough. Further the
strength of the cough depends on the excitability of
the patient; the greater this is, the more as a rule
will he cough. Sometimes the position of the
patient is of influence; if he lies mostly on the
diseased side the expectoration becomes more difficult
and coughing increases.</p>

<p>Coughing is generally that symptom which
soonest attracts the attention of the patient and his
surroundings. For that very reason consumption
is in its beginning stages easily confounded with
such other diseases as are also accompanied by
cough.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>At the same time we know of exceptional cases
where cough was entirely absent in the first stages
of the disease, or was at least so slight that it was
overlooked, and under such conditions the pale and
poor appearance and reduced strength is mistaken
for chlorosis or some other anaemic affection, also
the existing febrile excitements are wrongly judged,
or on account of lack of appetite or light derangements
of the stomach a stomachic affection is
surmised, until suddenly a hemorrhage of the lungs
clearly defines the true nature of the ailment.</p>

<p>On the other hand the cough may become so
violent that vomiting is caused at the same time.
Nevertheless many consumptives describe their cough
as very unimportant on account of their innate
sorrowless nature, and they will not even be discouraged
by the gravest symptoms. Often however it is
fear that induces the patients to make light of their
coughing, their spitting blood, their losing flesh and
to place but little importance on these circumstances.
A <i>hoarse</i> cough is a sure sign of a diseased <i>larynx</i>.</p>

<p>Many consumptives complain of cutting pains
between the shoulderblades, under the clavicles or in
the side; but these are rarely intense and are often
entirely wanting. Unfortunately it is unknown to the
average layman that the internal organs may suffer
extensive tearing down without an indication of
pain.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>The <i>Expectoration</i> of consumptives which is
thrown out by coughing with great exertion, is but
scant in the beginning, as a rule phlegmy, glassy
transparent and sticky. It is one of the suspicious
symptoms of developing pulmonary consumption if
this lasts for any greater length of time. Sometimes
sharply defined, yellowish stripes, at times branching,
appear in the same. Later on the expectoration
becomes more purulent, and of greenish-yellow or
greenish-gray color.</p>

<p>Still later the patients throw out rounded lumps
of greenish yellow or yellowish green color, which
flatten out like a coin in the spittoon. They sink in
water which is a sign of forboding evil.</p>

<p><i>Blood</i> appears in different quantities in the
sputum of consumptives. Bloody streaks are of no
importance; they may appear with every violent
cough. On the other hand the casting out of <i>pure
blood</i> is indeed serious.</p>

<p>The <i>quantity</i> of blood thrown out during an attack
may be very different, varying from a few drops
hardly a teaspoonful, to hundreds of grammes, even
more than a liter. It is generally light red, filled
with airbubbles, foamy, and is largely coughed out
in coagulated lumps. The coughing of blood is sometimes
preceded by a feeling of oppression, rushing
of blood to the head and palpitation. Some patients
experience a sweet taste in the mouth even before the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
bleeding. In many cases all preceding symptoms
are missing and the patient is suddenly attacked by
blood coughing during some more vigorous movement,
during the exertion of coughing or even without
any direct cause.</p>

<p><i>Blood coughing</i> seems to appear somewhat
more frequently with the <i>female</i> sex than with the
male and has with them unmistakable relations to
menstruation, as with the sick it often sets in before,
often after or even during the same and at such
times more frequently than at others.</p>

<p>It is of great importance for the layman to know
that a hemorrhage rarely leads to inevitable death.
Fatal hemorrhages are always preceded by warning
attacks. Blood coughing may appear at any stage
of consumption. In some cases it is particularly
lasting. Sometimes the patients experience considerable
relief from their feeling of oppression after a
hemorrhage.</p>

<p>A number of the consumptives as a rule complain
of <i>difficulty</i> in <i>deglutition</i>. This is caused by ulcers
on the posterior wall of the larynx.</p>

<p>With many patients the <i>appetite</i> is <i>undisturbed</i>
for a long time, and there are consumptives that will
eat a comparatively large dinner during an attack
of fever reaching 40&deg;&nbsp;C. Generally the desire to eat
disappears during the course of the disease, especially
toward the end of the sickness.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>The <i>stool</i> may be normal or costive, but is very
often diarrhoetic. Twelve or more evacuations may
take place during a day; as a rule they are much
increased by gasses and are of bad odor. They
weaken the patient very much and hasten the end.</p>

<p>One of the most constant attendants during the
course of consumption is the <i>Fever</i>. It is rather
irregular. In cases of slow process the fever is often
very insignificant; often it is only a state of general
excitement that takes hold of the patient afternoons,
slight dizziness, increased lustre of the eyes, slightly
flushed appearance, somewhat increased pulse, which
invites to test the temperature of the body by means
of a thermometer, which by the way shows it to be
about 38&deg;&nbsp;C. With quick consumption the fever is
generally high.</p>

<p><i>Sweat</i> is also a characteristic sign. The exceedingly
debilitating effect of night-sweats is well
known.</p>

<p>During the course of pulmonary consumption
extreme <i>emaciation</i> of the patient is brought about.
All tissues are subject to the same, most marked is
the disappearance of adipose tissue. This symptom is
of the greatest importance as a continued increase in
weight means improvement and even cure. Therefore
weighing the patient from time to time gives a sure
meter for the course of the disease.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>The <i>course</i> of pulmonary consumption is very
different. With quick consumption the end comes
within two or three months. Chronic pulmonary
consumption may last for years. With this improvements
in the fine season alternate with deterioration
in the winter.</p>

<p>Concerning the former <i>treatment</i> of pulmonary
consumption, this will also be applied in the future in
the same manner as far as preventive means and
general hygiene is referred to.</p>

<p>For every one will prefer to remain exempt from
consumption although it may now be possible to
cure those afflicted. The lately published and popularly
treated precautionary measures, especially with
reference to the expectoration of consumptives retain
their full value.</p>

<p>Henceforth the sputum is also to be thrown in
a <i>spittoon</i> which is either entirely empty or on
account of easier cleansing has the bottom covered
with a thin layer of water. It should not be permitted
to fill the spittoons with sand or sawdust as
the tubercle bacilli can be easily thrown up with the
dust.</p>

<p>In the case of a <i>sudden attack</i> of <i>cough</i> a <i>cloth</i>
should be held to the mouth to hinder spreading of
the fine spray, the same should also be used for
wiping the mouth. However the cloth must soon be
dampened and cleaned.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>As bits of the sputum easily stick to the <i>beard</i>
especially the moustache overhanging the lips,
therefore lung consumptives are advised to wear a
short or no beard.</p>

<p><i>Glasses</i>, <i>spoons</i>, etc. used by consumptives must
only be used by other persons after a thorough
cleaning with hot water.</p>

<p>The lungdiseased person should abstain from all
active and passive <i>kissing</i>, in unavoidable cases
kissing should be done on the forehead or cheek only,
or hold out those parts only to be kissed. In the same
way he should avoid to touch objects with his mouth
that may possible be put in the mouth by other
persons, especially children, for instance toy-trumpets.</p>

<p>In the case of <i>death</i> from pulmonary consumption,
the walls of all rooms and apartments used by
the deceased should be rubbed down with fresh baked
bread, which is a sure method of removing the bacilli.
The bread crumbs that may have dropped on the
floor may be removed by a thorough scrubbing with
soap, brush and lye.</p>

<p>Upholstered furniture, beds, clothes and wash
should be cleaned in a disinfecting place.</p>

<p>Do not wait with precautionary measures till
some member of the family has been attacked by
pulmonary consumption, but make preparation to
prevent the infection while everybody is still sound
and healthy.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>This care ought to begin in a measure with the
<i>birth of a child</i>. The same should not be nursed by
a mother with diseased lungs nor by a wet-nurse
with like affections. Generally wet-nurses are only
tested for syphilis; scrofula and tuberculosis receive
altogether too little attention.</p>

<p>An important precautionary measure consists in
the supervision of the <i>food</i>. The abattoirs and
dairies should be placed under the supervision of
practical physicians, and the sale of products derived
from tuberculous cattle be prohibited. This refers
to the milk in the first instance. Tuberculous cows
should be excluded from dairy-farms. Raw milk
should be avoided as much as possible as boiled milk
has the same value.</p>

<p>The <i>meat inspection</i> must be strictly conducted
especially with reference to tuberculosis in the case
of beef, pork and chickens. Sheep are not subject to
tuberculosis.</p>

<p>The <i>associations</i> of children in school and on the
play-ground should be watched; do not let them
visit in strange families before making thorough investigation
as to their sanitary relations.</p>

<p>The health of <i>servant girls</i> should receive greater
attention than formerly, as the disease is often
carried into the house by them as investigation has
proven.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>In the <i>schools</i> and kindergartens the teacher
ought to insist that children do not spit on the floor
or in the handkerchief; in case of necessity he should
keep sick children out of school and he should especially
follow these precautionary measures as
regards his own person.</p>

<p>The <i>cleaning of the floor</i> of a room should always
be done in a damp way.</p>

<p><i>Moving</i> into another house it is advised to rub
down the walls with fresh baked bread.</p>

<p>As regards <i>societies</i>, every society and every
health resort without exception and if possible every
hospital should be obliged to have its own apparatus
for disinfection and to make extensive use of it.
Smaller societies may unite to procure an apparatus
of the kind.</p>

<p>Especial attention should be given to the <i>sprinkling
of the streets</i> during the dry season.</p>

<p>The state and the larger congregations should
make it a point to maintain <i>institutions for consumptives</i>,
beyond the city limits if possible, a
healthy location in the country preferred.</p>

<p>Every one individually protects himself best from
consumption by a methodic habit of <i>washing with
cold water</i>, cold rubbing and baths. River and sea
baths are generally of excellent results; short shower
baths with cool water lasting 20&ndash;40 seconds are to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
be applied later on; they do not only harden the skin
but excite deep inhalations and exhalations and in
that way act as gymnastics of the lungs. More direct
is the action of muscular exercise, such as gymnastics,
riding horseback or bicycle, driving, skating, rowing,
etc. The carriage of children must be regulated, the
drooping forward of their shoulders must be corrected
by strengthening the muscles of the back and
shoulders by means of dumbbell and other exercises.</p>

<p>All this must still be observed in the future. On
the other hand above all the numberless remedies
will be dropped that have heretofore been applied as
presumably specific remedies for consumption.</p>

<p>Creosote, which was so much praised at its appearance
a few years ago and still applied, because
of the non-existence of a better remedy, will be
dropped into obliteration and with it Guajacol which
was just getting to be the "fashion".</p>

<p>All the various inhalation methods that have
matured in later years will disappear from the
picture plane as far as this has not ever now happened.</p>

<p>The medical remedies, which were given for the
torturing cough, for hemorrhage of the lungs, sweats
etc., will in most cases be superfluous after this.
Hemorrhages will now and then still be experienced
as the same may set in unexpectedly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>The diatetic cures with whey, koumiss, grapes etc.
will retain their importance and also the bathing resorts
will be hunted up by patients as formerly.</p>

<p>The owners also of special institutes for curing
pulmonary consumption need not despair with the
idea that they will not be needed in the future. On the
contrary, those needing cure will flock to them in all
the greater numbers, as they now know that they
certainly will be restored to health within a definitely
limited time.</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="The_other_forms_of_Tuberculosis" id="The_other_forms_of_Tuberculosis"></a>The other forms of Tuberculosis.</h2>


<p>Of the other forms of tuberculosis <i>laryngeal consumption</i>
is very often combined with pulmonary
consumption. It is estimated that this is true of at
least one-fourth of all cases of pulmonary consumption.</p>

<p>At first laryngeal consumption can not in any
way be distinguished from an ordinary inflammation
of the larynx. A certain weakness and sensitiveness
of the organs however is suspicious, also great
liability to hoarseness. On the other hand laryngeal
consumption may exist without any sort of ailing to
the patient.</p>

<p>These appear later, however, when lung tuberculosis
is progressing. The larynx shows more distinct
outlines on the lean throat, difficulty in swallowing
is experienced, pains radiate toward the ear. Food
and drinks come up again after being swallowed.</p>

<p>The painful cough has a hollow, barking, harsh
sound, provokes vomiting, and the sputum together<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
with foul breath consists of foamy, slimy, purulent
lumps. Breathing gradually becomes more difficult
and louder.</p>

<p>As regards the duration of laryngeal consumption
it generally runs parallel with pulmonary consumption.
If the latter progresses more rapidly
so also will the destruction of the larynx by the
tubercle-bacilli be a more rapid one and vice versa.
In several cases it has been observed that, if pulmonary
consumption progressed or remained without any
extraordinary symptoms, those with diseased larynx
have lived for years, with alternating improvements
and diminutions, and also an occasional suspension
of all symptoms, till on account of often only a trivial,
evil influence a new stimulus is given and the disease
found an unexpectedly rapid completion of its course.</p>

<p>Until now only few cases of laryngeal consumption
could be looked upon as really cured. Lately it
has been tried to accomplish cures especially by the
application of caustics. This will not now be necessary.
But those afflicted in this way, will henceforth
be obliged to try and live in air free from dust, to
travel south during the winter and to subject themselves
to a general strengthening treatment.</p>

<p><i>Tuberculosis</i> of the <i>tongue</i> is relatively very
scarce. The individual in such a case nearly always
shows pronounced pulmonary tuberculosis. Sometimes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
tuberculosis of the tongue is combined with
tuberculous sores on the lips and also on the anus.</p>

<p>Tongue tuberculosis forms small ulcers, generally
on the rim, very seldomly on the back of the tongue.
They always are very small, generally about the
size of lentils or peas. They often remain unchanged
for months. At times they are very painful, though
as a rule the pain is mild. The male sex is attacked
by tongue tuberculosis especially frequently.</p>

<p>The treatment before this consisted in cutting
out all the diseased parts; now it will be much
simpler.</p>

<p><i>Nasal tuberculosis</i> appears similar to the common
stopping up of the nose. But when ulcers are
formed, the secretions from the nose take on a
purulent somewhat malodorous character. But if
the affection is neglected, the secretion becomes
bloody and of very bad odor.</p>

<p>Until now nasal tuberculosis had been treated
by applying caustics to the ulcerated portions.</p>

<p><i>Tuberculosis of the intestines</i> or <i>intestinal consumption</i>
is especially found in <i>children</i>. The
appearance of the same is already characteristic;
the limbs are emaciated and withered; the old-looking
wrinkled face shows a harsh contrast with
the immoderately expanded body (frog-belly) which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
is caused by an accumulation of gases in the limp
intestines which are then filled to bursting. Many
such children have succumbed to gradually progressing
emaciation and weakness.</p>

<p>Probably it will not be possible to save all
children in the future that have been stricken with
this disease as many are wanting in sufficient vitality
to resist all external influences.</p>

<p>With adults intestinal consumption makes itself
known by everlasting diarrhoea, a result of the
numerous ulcers in the intestines which have been
caused by the tubercle-bacilli.</p>

<p><i>Tuberculosis of the brain and of the cerebral
membranes</i> also attack children especially. Before
this no attempts have been made to try whether it is
now possible to cure the <i>tuberculous inflammation of
the cerebral membranes</i> which has previously been
unconditionally fatal. The decision will certainly
soon be made.</p>

<p>We will give a fuller description of the symptoms
of this disease to thus enable timely summons of
medical interference. This disease will be known to
many as "acute hydrocephalus."</p>

<p>As a rule children of 2&ndash;7 years of age are attacked
by this fearful disease. The antecedents are
extremely peculiar and manifold. Even two or three
weeks before the outbreak of the real sickness, emaciation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
takes place from which the face is strangely
enough entirely exempt, so that children, when
dressed show no signs of a change. Attentive
mothers and nurses, however, regularly notice the
same and especially the appearance of the ribs
causes no little anxiety. With this a slight pallor of
the face is associated and a peculiar lustre of the
eyes. The children lose their former feeling of
gayety and activity. They sleep more than usual,
withdraw from their favorite game, they become
grumbly and shy toward their surroundings
and cry for the slightest reason. It also is very
peculiar that they avoid trying their former little
tricks, such as climbing up on chairs, opening of
door bolts that are almost out of their reach, they
even will not try to look through a latticed window
and asked to do so, decidedly refuse. Boys, that
would not stand anything from their associates,
that fought and wrestled as long as their strength
permitted it, sneak away cowardly and crying from
such attacks. Other children again become extraordinarily
tender-hearted and affectionate, they hug
their parents continually and can hardly console
themselves when they leave them.</p>

<p>In the case of older children that have already
learnt something, teachers notice unusual inattention
and indifference, committing to memory comes
harder than usual and what is finally learnt is
recited in an awkward and stammering way. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
children sleep unusually much and often by day; on
the other hand their sleep at night is less sound and
is interrupted by horrid dreams, frequent turning
over in the bed and frequent clamorous outcries.</p>

<p>The appetite is lessened, and often a craving is
noticed for stimulating food of which, however, little
is eaten. Thirst is not increased. Urinal secretion
is somewhat diminished and the urine is characterized
by a brick-colored precipitate. The stool is
rather costive, especially with larger children; but
diarrhoea may attend this disease. The latter is
principally the case with small children that are in
the stage of first teething.</p>

<p>Headache is rarely felt and hardly ever complained
of even by larger children; dizziness and
unsteady walking is frequently observed. The
children quite often complain of stomach-ache, which
is very much increased by pressure on the abdomen.</p>

<p>Fever is not generally attendant, but the same
may be present.</p>

<p>The symptoms just described, separately or
collectively, gradually increase; the children finally
take to their bed and now the <i>real cerebral affection</i>
developes.</p>

<p>Now the principal symptoms are: vomiting, constipation,
slow pulse, irregular abrupt breathing,
increased temperature of the skin, contracted abdomen,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
headache, great excitement alternating with
drowsiness, beginning decrease of reason, and deranged
ability of moving the limbs.</p>

<p>As regards <i>vomiting</i>, this is almost a continuous
symptom and generally appears in the earlier stages.
But the duration of vomiting is very different.
Some children vomit only for one or more days and
not all they have eaten, while others vomit continuously
from the beginning of the disease till they are
relieved by death, and no food can be found that is
not thrown up shortly after its being eaten. In this
connection it is a peculiar fact that vomiting will
not recur if it has once ceased for twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>Very important for the recognition of the disease
is the manner of vomiting. For a child suffering
from a spoiled stomach will be troubled with nausea,
belching, choking and cold sweat long before it is
forced to vomit, while children with acute hydrocephalus
will throw up without any previous symptoms
of that kind, just as though they filled the
mouth with water and spit it out again. Vomiting
is facilitated when children are raised or placed on
their side. It ceases for the time the stomach is
empty, but as soon as fluid or even solid food is
taken in it will be cast out at once without
causing any particular distress or inconvenience to
the child. Gall is very rarely mixed with the vomit.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>A second and nearly as constant a symptom is
<i>constipation</i> from which nearly three-fourths of the
diseased children suffer. As a rule cathartics have
no effect and are generally thrown out through the
mouth. This constipation will not last till the end,
for a few pappy stools appear later on whether
purgatives are administered or not. Violent diarrhoea
resulting from intestinal tuberculosis may be
discontinued at the beginning of acute hydrocephalus.
But the later stools will again be thin and of
cadaverous odor.</p>

<p>During the latter stages of the disease children
will often <i>fail to pass urine</i> for twenty-four hours, so
that the physician is obliged to draw it off with a
catheter.</p>

<p>The appetite does not disappear entirely as a
rule. There may not be any desire for food, but
generally little difficulty is experienced in inducing
children to take milk or broth, which is all the more
surprising as vomiting regularly follows.</p>

<p>The <i>fever</i> is generally not very intense. The
temperature of the head, especially the forehead, is
considerably increased in all cases and remains so
until death ensues, while the feet have great tendency
to getting cold.</p>

<p>The <i>pulse</i> is characteristic in many cases. In
the beginning of the disease the pulse is quickened<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
only to slacken after a few days. The number of
beats may be reduced to 40&ndash;60 a minute (normal
90&ndash;100), however it does not commonly remain at
a certain figure, but varies, often inside of an hour,
so that at one time 40, then 60 and again 80 beats
may be counted inside of twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>The pulse again increases 1&ndash;3 days before death
and then to such a rate that it is almost impossible
to count it. It may reach 180 and 200 beats a
minute. As soon as this rate of the pulse follows
one of the reductions described above a speedy death
may be predicted.</p>

<p>Of great importance are the variations in respiration.
In the beginning stages of the disease breathing
is normal except in such case where tuberculosis
has made great progress in the lungs and in the case
of high fever. Then of course breathing becomes
more rapid. Acute hydrocephalus influences respiration
in such a way that it slackens and becomes
irregular. In one minute children may breath fifteen
times, in another thirty, then again 20 times; at one
time breathing may be very slight with almost invisible
expansion of the chest and without any noise
whatever, then again it may consist of deep sighs;
these are also characteristic of this particular disease.
Sometimes breathing is completely discontinued for
ten seconds and more.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>If the pulse attains that extreme rate shortly
before death the rate of breathing will also be increased.</p>

<p>As regards the <i>skin</i>, the same is generally damp
from the beginning of the disease; severe sweats are
observed on the head; with progressing disease the
skin becomes dry, brittle, comes off in flake-like scales
and only when the death-predicting increase of the
pulse sets in, there appears a profuse sweat, the cold
sweat of death.</p>

<p><i>Headache</i> is also a prominent and pretty nearly
constant symptom. As has been mentioned before,
it does not as a rule attend the precursory symptoms.
It generally begins with vomiting and soon
becomes so violent that older children constantly
cry aloud and lament, while the smaller ones put
their little hands up to their head, pull their hair and
ears and restlessly roll about on the pillow.</p>

<p>These expressions of pain last as long as children
retain consciousness, a particular part of the head is
not commonly pointed out, but asked about it the
majority point to the forehead. With small children
automatic movements are noticed that also seem to
refer to headache, and which consist in rapidly
placing the hand on the head and then drawing it
back.</p>

<p>The larger children complain of <i>pains in the
bowels</i>, especially in the region of the stomach,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
which remarkably often, though not regularly, become
more intense by pressing and may become so
violent that the children cry out aloud with pain,
when the stomach or other portion of the abdomen
is but slightly touched. But these pains do not last
as long as the headache, they often stop suddenly, at
times return.</p>

<p>The shape of the <i>abdomen</i> is extraordinarily
characteristic. In the beginning nothing remarkable
can be noticed, but after the symptoms of acute
hydrocephalus, vomiting, constipation, etc., have
lasted for some time, the abdomen gradually decreases
in size, becomes wrinkled and collapses until
it finally assumes a scaphoid shape and by slight
pressure the large iliac artery can be felt on the
spinal column.</p>

<p>This contraction of the abdomen is attendant in
every case of tuberculous meningitis.</p>

<p>If the large <i>fontanel</i> on the head is not yet
closed, the same will gradually bulge out as the
disease progresses.</p>

<p>The <i>mental activity</i> suffers premature derangements,
such as have been fully mentioned in the
description of the precursory symptoms. The most
striking is the confused, staring look, the peevish and
surly behavior, and again in other cases the extreme<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
indifference toward otherwise well-liked persons and
things. Later on actual delirium sets in, but
generally of a quiet nature.</p>

<p>A very common symptom is a loud, plaintive
outcry, that is repeated at longer or shorter intervals.
Children often cry out at partly regular
intervals during a whole night; these cries are always
accompanied by a loud sigh. These symptoms of
excitement being extremely tormenting and depressing
for the sympathizing relatives, fortunately last
no longer than 6&ndash;8 days at the most, and are succeeded
by a deep <i>stupor</i>.</p>

<p>If the children have once become <i>unconscious</i>,
they do not recover again as a rule but remain so
until death; delirium and stupor may alternate with
each other in certain cases, but the former process
is by far the most frequent.</p>

<p><i>Convulsions</i> appear only in the later stages. At
first the interval between the attacks are long, often
as many as three or four days intervene. Commonly
however they come much oftener and may in some
cases last for hours. All extremities are affected by
these convulsions, the eyes become red, are rolled in
every direction and turning way up are fixed so that
nothing but the whites is visible. After several
minutes, often after two or three hours, these general<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
convulsions subside, the children, now very pale, drop
into a deep sleep and their general condition appears
much reduced.</p>

<p>Different muscular groups especially those of the
face are subject to <i>local cramps</i>. The upper lip may
become distorted, convulsive smiles have been observed,
also peculiar sucking motions. The children
point their lips and flatten them again, sometimes
for hours in succession.</p>

<p>In the latter stages a squinting of one or both
eyes may be noticed but this may again disappear.</p>

<p><i>Grinding of the teeth</i> is another very peculiar
symptom which is well-known and feared by experienced
nurses. The <i>arms</i> are subject to various
motions, at times sweeping automaton like, then
again convulsive contractions, sometimes trembling
of the muscles, at others a throbbing of the tendons.
Many patients put their hands to their sexual
organs and make motions tending to onanism.</p>

<p>The <i>legs</i> are not subject to cramps as much as
the arms; they are mostly bent and drawn up in a
half paralyzed condition.</p>

<p>The <i>muscles of the neck and back</i> are very much
contracted and most children, when raised or laid on
their side, bend the head far back.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>In most children an extreme sensibility at being
touched is observed. They may be handled with the
greatest possible care and lifted most tenderly, a
slight pressure on the head, body or hands in changing
their position will be violently resisted with
obvious expressions of pain. In the latter stages
this extreme sensibility gives way to <i>insensibility</i>.</p>

<p>Then the children may be pinched and poked,
they may be turned and moved from one side to the
other without any consideration, they will not resist
and only give expression to the remaining sensibility
by a low whimper. The lack of sensibility may be
especially marked in the eyes; these can be touched
with the fingers, without causing a closing of the
lids.</p>

<p>The sense of <i>hearing</i> seems to continue its functions
until very late. Children show that they hear
as long as they are not completely unconscious;
even when addressed in a low tone of voice they
react somewhat. The sense of <i>smell and taste</i> also
are lost toward the very end of the disease.</p>

<p><i>Paralytic</i> affections appear during the final
stages. It has been observed in some cases that the
arm and limb are paralyzed on one side only. Often
one upper eyelid is paralyzed and hangs down on
one side of the face and the muscles of the tongue
may be affected.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>Generally the patient dies after violent general
convulsions that last for hours. Exceptionally only
the paralytic symptoms increase gradually and
cause death without any agony or struggle, simply a
discontinuance of the functions constituting life.</p>

<p>The duration of the disease varies from 2&ndash;4
weeks from the beginning of the characteristic symptoms.
Generally the day when the children take to
the bed is fixed as the beginning of the disease.</p>

<p>The former methods of treatment have been a
signal and absolute failure in every case. Every
child that has once been attacked with this disease
has heretofore died. Until now Koch has not been
able to make any experiments with acute hydrocephalus,
so that it remains an open question whether it
is now possible to cure this disease.</p>

<p>Besides tuberculosis of the cerebral membranes
with which children are afflicted, <i>tuberculosis of the
brain</i> may occur, although this disease is very rare.
Tuberculosis of the brain appears in the shape of
small tumors in all parts of the brain. After
longer duration of tuberculosis of the brain, tubercular
meningitis appears.</p>

<p>The process of this disease may be varied. In
some cases the development of cerebral tuberculosis
is manifested by the sudden appearance of high fever
temperatures or violent headache; to this may be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
added, slackening of the pulse, vomiting, stiff neck
and isolated cases of palsy; sometimes an attack of
convulsions is the first manifestation.</p>

<p>In other cases the beginning can not be accurately
determined, as the beginning symptoms of the disease
are so slight as to escape notice. Impaired
process of nutrition, languor and headache are
symptoms from which the existence of some serious
affliction may be inferred without being able to
determine its nature in the earlier stages.</p>

<p>Again in other cases the disease may proceed
through all its stages without any cerebral appearances
whatever. This is especially true of small
tubercles and of diseases of infants. However, we
more frequently observe in children than in adults
convulsions of varied intensity and distribution.</p>

<p>Nutrition is more and more impaired as the disease
progresses, in isolated cases only, a temporary
improvement may be observed.</p>

<p>The <i>end</i> of cerebral tuberculosis has been <i>death</i>
before this. Ten days to two weeks, even three weeks
may pass from the first appearance of tubercular
meningitis to the completion of the process of the
disease, attended by feverish motions characteristic
of this condition and by cerebral symptoms, first
with the character of excitement, later on with that
of palsy.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>The treatment of cerebral tuberculosis has been
entirely insufficient before this. Let us hope that it
will be possible to effect a cure by means of Koch's
new method.</p>

<p><i>Tuberculosis of the Kidneys</i> is met with from the
earliest childhood till old age. Most frequently
the male sex is afflicted during manhood.</p>

<p>In most cases tuberculosis also exists in other
organs, especially in the urinary and sexual apparatus.
The existence of pulmonary or intestinal tuberculosis
is not essential.</p>

<p>The symptoms of renal tuberculosis are of such
general and indefinite character, that it is often impossible
to fully determine the disease. Now, however,
it will be more easily possible on account of
Koch's discovery.</p>

<p>The <i>urine</i> may, but need not contain pus and
blood. Sometimes small lumps are found in the
urine.</p>

<p><i>Pains</i> are only sometimes felt in the renal regions;
<i>fever</i> may be occasionally attendant.</p>

<p>The disease lasts for months and years; though
before now it has inevitably resulted in death, though
it has in exceptional cases taken ten years or more.</p>

<p>The internal treatment of renal tuberculosis was
ineffectual, surgical treatment has been attended<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
with greater success. This consisted in removing the
diseased kidney. Now good results will possibly be
attained by the application of Koch's method to
cure and resource to surgery will be taken in exceptional
cases only.</p>

<p><i>Tuberculosis of the suprarenal capsules</i> is of
very rare occurrence. It leads to a peculiar change
in the color of the skin; the same turns dark brown
or bronze color. Sooner or later death results.</p>

<p>Perhaps the application of Koch's method will,
besides curing the disease, give us information regarding
the functions of the suprarenal capsules
about which nothing whatever is as yet known.</p>

<p>A large space in the realm of disease is claimed
by <i>tuberculous affections of the bones and joints</i>.
These afflictions appear particularly in childhood
though manhood is by no means exempt. They may
appear in all portions of the body, although a
marked preference is shown for certain parts. Although
the tubercle-bacilli are infinitely small, they
possess the power to cause suppuration of the bones
and joints and to produce acute inflammation of
these parts.</p>

<p>Most frequently tubercular affections of the
bones are found in the hip-joints, the knee and the
spinal column.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span><i>Tuberculous inflammation of the hip-joint</i> is
principally a disease occurring in childhood; though
it rarely appears before the third year. It is most
frequent from the fifth to the tenth year.</p>

<p>Inflammation of the hip-joint developes very
slowly in children, it generally takes months before
the slightest beginning symptoms reach a threatening
appearance. The first sign is <i>lameness</i>; among
laymen tuberculous inflammation of the hip-joints is
known as "voluntary limping."</p>

<p>By limping we understand that mode of walking
in which one leg is spared and by this the trunk is
supported only a short time by one extremity and
all the longer by the other. In every painful affection
of the lower extremity limping results as the
weight of the body increases the pain. The lameness
in the case of diseased hip-joint has something
peculiar about it, inasmuch as not only a part of the
extremity but the whole of it is dragged. For this
very reason parents of children afflicted with inflammation
of the hip-joint use the expression "the
child draws" or "drags the leg".</p>

<p>In the beginning even the examining physician
finds no symptoms of disease in the joint. No
swelling, no abnormal position, no restriction of the
freedom of motion, no pain from pressure or while
moving, in short nothing can be found that would
otherwise indicate the beginning of an inflammation
of the joints.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>Yet <i>lameness only</i> is sufficient data from which
we may infer the probable beginning of hip-joint inflammation.
It is much better to overestimate the
significance of this symptom than to miss the proper
time for calling in the aid of a physician by placing
too little confidence on it.</p>

<p>The second symptom, <i>pain</i>, rarely attends the
beginning of lameness, generally it comes several
weeks later and in the case of very slow development
of tubercularly inflamed hip-joint several
months later. In very small children the attendance
of pain is manifested by the fact that they will not
play and they often wake up in the night and begin
to cry.</p>

<p>Children from the fourth and fifth year upward
definitely point out the hip as the seat of pain, sometimes,
however, the knee-joint on the diseased side
is designated with great determination. This pain
in the knee has often been the cause of mistakes.</p>

<p>Later on painfulness of the hip-joint is experienced
from pressure and at about the same time the
movements are impeded.</p>

<p>Then the leg takes a peculiar position. The
thigh is slightly bent and rolls outward. For convenience
the child drops the half of the pelvis corresponding
to the diseased hip-joint, and naturally
raises the other half. From this apparently a curvature
of the spinal column results in the lumbar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
region. Apparently only, for when the child is laid
down and the morbid position of the thigh is restored
the curvature of the lumbar column disappears.</p>

<p>During the further progress of the disease the
pain is increased, and the sensibility may become so
acute that the slightest movement of the limb, even
a shaking of the bed in which the patient lies will
cause the most intense pain. In the previous stage
walking could only be done for short distances and
then awkwardly, now it is entirely impossible.
Children are obliged to lie in bed night and day, and
under these altered conditions there is a change of the
position of the extremity. The increased sensibility
induces the child to seek the medium position, the leg
is bent more than in the position mentioned above,
it is halfway straightened.</p>

<p>To this is added, that the child can not lie well on
the sensitive and swollen hip; with right side hip-joint
inflammation it turns on the left. As the diseased
and bent thigh does not then rest on the mattress
the same is placed on the healthy limb for support
and for protection from movements, in the same
manner as we lay one leg on the other in a healthy
condition when we sleep on our side.</p>

<p>The actual danger to life in tuberculous hip-joint
inflammation begins with the time when the child
takes to his bed. The fatal end comes almost without
exception after suppuration has commenced,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
very rarely before that time. Total suppuration of
the hip-joint is an almost absolutely fatal process.
If this suppuration sets in suddenly, it may result in
an early death with attendance of acute fever. In
other cases several weeks may elapse from beginning
suppuration till death.</p>

<p>A complete cure of tuberculous hip-joint inflammation
may come about spontaneously. But often
the knee remains bent and unserviceable for walking,
so that crutches or machines must be used.</p>

<p>Even before this the beginning stages were
treated with fair prospects of success, and it is a
lamentable fact that in many cases the import of
these seemingly trivial symptoms has been underestimated.</p>

<p><i>Rest</i> is of the greatest importance during the
very first stages of the disease in which the attending
symptoms are of so indefinite a character that it
is almost impossible to know whether hip-joint inflammation
will develop or not; the child must not
be allowed to walk. Aside from this the application
of brine-, malt- and sea-water baths is advised. An
abundance of nourishing food is of just as great
importance. All this will also retain its significance
in the future.</p>

<p>Formerly recourse to surgery has been taken
during the later stages of the disease in which
suppuration of the internal parts of the joint has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
commenced and large parts of the diseased bones
may have become mortified. An incision is made
into the joint, the same is exposed and all diseased
portions are carefully removed. In the future this
operation must probably also be performed, although
with the difference that the prospects of
success are now much more certain than formerly
when relapses only too often followed the operation.</p>

<p><i>Tuberculous inflammation of the knee-joint</i> is, as
said before, very frequent with children and is rather
lingering in the beginning. Here also a slight dragging
or limping of the diseased leg can be noticed.
The child when asked about the limping, or of its own
accord, complains of pain in the joint after walking
or when the part is pressed; at first nothing abnormal
can be seen on the knee by the layman.</p>

<p>On closer examination, however, by comparing
the two knees it will be found that the grooves on
each side of the patella, which give the healthy knee-joint
the beautifully modeled shape, have nearly or
quite disappeared; nothing more can be noticed.</p>

<p>The hinderance in motion may be so insignificant,
that the children may slightly limp about for
weeks and months and complain but little. Generally
the physician is not called until the limb begins to
hurt and swell after continued exertion.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>The swelling which in the beginning is hardly
noticeable is now more plainly visible, the knee-joint
is evenly rounded and quite sensitive to pressure.</p>

<p>If the disease is not now properly treated, its
further course will be as follows: the patient may
perhaps linger for several months; then comes a
period when he must keep to his bed uninterruptedly
because moving results in too much pain; generally
the limb becomes more and more bent.</p>

<p>Now particularly painful points appear on the
joint, especially on the inner or outer side or in the
bend of the knee; on one of these points a soft portion
distinctly developes, the skin becomes reddened
and finally suppurates from the internal parts outward
and breaks after a few months; thin purulent
matter mixed with flakes is discharged. The pains
now cease, and the condition is improved; but this
improvement does not last; soon another abscess
is formed and thus it continues.</p>

<p>Meanwhile perhaps two or three years may have
elapsed; the general condition becomes greatly reduced.
The child, formerly strong and healthy, has
now become lean, the discharges of matter have
often been attended by acute febrile attacks; the
patient becomes exhausted, loses his appetite and digestion
becomes more impaired from week to week.
Even now a spontaneous change for the better is
possible, though this happens very rarely; more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
frequently the disease progresses and leads to death
from exhaustion resulting from severe suppuration
and continual attacks of fever.</p>

<p>Restoration to health is indicated by decreased
suppurative discharges; the openings of the fistulae
contract, the general condition is improved, the
appetite is restored, etc. Finally the fistulae heal,
the joint becomes fixed at an angle or bent or otherwise
crippled, but painfulness disappears and the
patient escapes with his life and a stiff leg. This is
the most favorable result known to have been obtained
in severe cases. The joint may become a solid
bony immovable mass or may admit of slight movements.
The whole process may last from two to four
years.</p>

<p>The former treatment of tuberculous inflammation
of the knee-joint was either of a general or a
local nature. The general treatment was designed
to strengthen and nourish, and will continue to be
applied in the future.</p>

<p>The local treatment consisted in the application
of salves, brushing with tincture of iodine, spanish
fly plasters, wet and dry bandages. As with inflamed
hip-joint absolute rest by lying in bed is of
the greatest importance.</p>

<p>If after a certain period of rest and application
of the above-named remedies no improvement in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
state of health could be noticed, the diseased joint
was laid in plaster or confined with splints.</p>

<p>If even then, after such treatment for months, no
improvement could be noticed but rather that the
general state of health was reduced, nothing remained
to be done excepting an operation, by which
all the diseased parts of the knee-joint were removed,
or amputation, that is, the taking off of the diseased
limb. The latter method was generally adopted in
the case of feeble and emaciated individuals and those
who had passed the age of early manhood, as with
these the removal of the diseased parts did not, as a
rule, result in an improvement of the general condition,
which was especially intended.</p>

<p>Now tuberculous inflammation of the knee-joint
will be treated by Koch's method and in extreme
cases only will operation be necessary. At all rates,
an absolute cure will be easily effected.</p>

<p>Aside from the hip- and knee-joint the <i>spinal
column</i> is most frequently attacked by tuberculosis.
Here also it is the youthful age, from the third year
upward, that has to suffer most from this serious
disease. Adults are rarely attacked by it and with
them it generally appears in connection with general
tuberculosis.</p>

<p>The tubercle-bacilli penetrate into the substance
of the vertebrae, destroy the same and transform it
into purulent matter. As a result the destroyed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
vertebrae sink or rather settle down and cause a
curvature of the spine, in other words a humpback.</p>

<p>In the beginning the symptoms of diseased spine
are very indefinite and misleading. The patient
rarely complains of pain at first, and it is only
noticed that the sick child easily tires of standing or
walking and tends to hold on to chairs and similar
objects with his hands to relieve the spinal column of
the weight. From such uncertain data it is of
course impossible to recognize the disease.</p>

<p>Only then when the softened vertebrae give way
under the weight of the body, that is when the humpback
begins to develop, can tuberculous inflammation
of the spine be surmised with any degree of
certainty.</p>

<p>As a rule two other characteristic phenomena
appear which are dependent on the pain in the
affected spinal column. The child, while standing,
places his hand on the thighs and thus directly supports
part of the weight of the trunk with the lower
extremities; at the same time he avoids bending the
spinal column forward. This anxious care for the
diseased vertebrae is especially noticeable when the
child attempts to pick up an object from the floor.
While the healthy child bends freely forward, the sick
one crouches down and while bending the knee and
hip keeps the spinal column as straight and stiff
as possible. Frequently a small spot on the spinal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
column is found to be extremely sensitive to pressure
in this stage; but such a subjective symptom must
be considered with caution especially with children.</p>

<p>This humpback, which is a result of tuberculous
inflammation of the spine, must not be confounded
with the humpback caused by rickets. With the
latter the curvature is more uniform as a rule, and in
the start at least, disappears while in a horizontal
position. Besides the humpback resulting from rickets
appears between the first and fourth years of age,
while tuberculous inflammation of the spine rarely
begins before the fourth year. And finally rickets
never causes suppuration while this is always the
case with inflammation of the spine.</p>

<p>The progress of suppuration is downward as a
rule and does not admit of examination until it gets
near to the surface of the body; before this the feverish
conditions toward evening are the only signs
that indicate beginning suppuration. Ardent fever
is not attendant during this time; the temperature
does not exceed 38 or 38.6&deg;&nbsp;C. and even such trifling
increase of temperature may be wanting.</p>

<p>As soon as the skin is reached by the originally
deepseated centres of suppuration, it gradually becomes
red and later on also suppurated. If the skin
is broken and the matter discharged, great care
must be taken to keep the wound clean, as otherwise
the suppurative cavities may suddenly become<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
ichorous and lead to rapid death. In other cases
this extreme result is not caused and fistulae are
formed from which the ichor constantly flows. Small
bits of mortified and broken off bones may be
thrown out with the matter.</p>

<p>As a result of the sinking and settling of the
vertebrae the spinal chord may suffer from pressure
and contusion as it is contained in a channel formed
by the vertebrae. Aside from certain pain it may
result in paralysis of certain parts.</p>

<p>Formerly the diagnosis of tuberculous inflammation
of the spine in its beginning stages was very
uncertain. A great number of afflicted are at present
cured by surgical treatment; in former times this
was not possible, as the majority of patients died in
whose case the disease had progressed to suppuration.
But the curvature of the spine could not be
removed by any former treatment and can not be by
Koch's new method. Vertebrae once destroyed can
in no way be restored to their normal condition.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the number of patients whose life is
spared will be a still greater one and the number of
complete cures will also be increased in a short time.
Formerly tuberculous inflammation of the spine was
treated as follows: the abscesses were opened and
antiseptics carefully applied: mechanical apparatus
and corsets were used to aid in a natural cure.
These apparatus will surely be of inestimable value
at the application of Koch's method.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>As has been stated before tuberculosis may
attack all other bones and joints and there cause the
most serious derangement. Formerly these tuberculous
afflictions were treated surgically or by means
of iodoform, which has produced pretty good results
in certain cases.</p>

<p>However it will certainly be possible to produce
still better results with Koch's method of treatment,
especially in the restoration of the functions of
the afflicted parts. Here, as in all tuberculous affections,
it is particularly essential to subject the
respective case to treatment in as early a stage as
possible and before incurable destruction of the
tissues of the bones and joints have been caused.</p>

<p>A certain disease of the skin called <i>lupus</i> (ringworm)
must be counted in with the number of diseases
generated by the tubercle-bacillus.</p>

<p>Lupus may begin in two different ways. Either
in the form of a purple spot, which is raised above
the level of the skin and which has no definite limits
but blends with the healthy parts; or as a slightly
raised, moderately firm, darkred grain, sharply
limited and about the size of a pinhead or millet
seed.</p>

<p>If the disease has begun in the shape of spots, the
afflicted portions of the skin gradually swell during
the process of the disease. Several isolated knots
appear around which the disease spreads more and
more.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>While the disease thus takes possession of greater
area and developes new centers, a uniform scaling off
of all knots begins.</p>

<p>After prolonged existence, sometimes after short
duration, decay and casting off of the epidermis in
its entire thickness supercedes the scaling process,
and suppuration transforms the ringworm into an
ulcer covered by a dirty-brown rind and disagreeably
colored serum.</p>

<p>The ulcers of lupus are of various, generally
irregular shape, the rims not hard, the ground flat
and covered with purulent matter and decayed tissue;
they are commonly surrounded by a faint reddish
areola. These ulcers gradually become epulotic and
form irregular, generally slightly protruding white
scars in which new tubercles may appear.</p>

<p>Lupus appears most frequently in the face and
especially frequent on the nose. Sometimes its appearance
is indicated only by an inflammation and
swelling of the mucous membranes of the nose and
at the same time a reddening of the epidermis. The
nostrils are stopped up by a thin rind which, if torn
off, is replaced by a thicker one below which an ulcer
is formed that spreads with greater rapidity on the
mucous membranes of the nose than on the external
epidermis of the same.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>Sometimes the whole process on the nose is so
rapid, that very often the physician is not called
to the patient, before a large part of the wing of
the nose or of the nasal epidermis is destroyed and
deep ulcers have developed under the rind. New
tubercles of lupus are commonly noticed to spring up
on the margins of these ulcers; the cartilage as a
rule resists the progress of the disease for a longer
period and may be unhurt, while the skin on the
wing of the nose may be completely destroyed.</p>

<p>Frequently the process is extended to the mucous
lining of the hard palate and to the gums. Lupus
generally appears on the lips in the same manner as
in the nose. The upper lip especially appears very
much swollen and covered with ulcers after a
prolonged existence of the affection. Sometimes even
the aperture of the mouth itself is reduced in size by
the development of ulcers and scars on the surrounding
parts.</p>

<p>If the process extends to the lower eyelid, the
connective tissue as a rule becomes much swollen and
reddened. The malady especially attacks the inner
angle of the eye, destroys the entrance of the lachrymal
duct, and from there the lupous tubercles
appear on the connective tissue. Gradually
tubercular formations develop on the cornea and
sight becomes impaired.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>On other parts of the face lupus generally appears
in the form of small knots, about the size of millet
seeds, which remain for a time then multiply and
spread. The epidermis swells between these knots
and irregular ulcers develop on a hard swollen and
glossy ground, and are covered by dark brown
rinds.</p>

<p>Tubercles appear anew on the margins of the
ulcers and in the spaces between them, isolated whitish
spots of sunken or raised scab tissue are observed
on which very frequently lupous tubercles again
develop.</p>

<p>Lupus appears on the throat, neck, back, breast,
and the extremities, most frequently in serpentine
form i. e. swellings of the skin develop, being
arranged in curves, they progress in the same manner,
these are transformed into just so many ulcers.
Between these whitish scarred spots are noticeable on
which small red lupous tubercles again appear.</p>

<p>Lupus is more frequently found on the extremities
than on the trunk. The surface of the skin is
found to be tense and glossy on a firm base which is
affected by lupus.</p>

<p>Deep ulcerous formations of lupus are sometimes
observed on the fingers and toes, particularly on the
finger-joints, these may at times penetrate into the
inner parts of the joints, secreting whitish pus and
covered with a thick rind.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>As regards the difference between lupus and syphilitic
diseases it has been found that lupus commonly
developes before puberty while syphilis appears in
the mature age.</p>

<p>The ulcers of lupus are often round like those of
syphilis with sharply defined margins, but at the
same time they are flat accompanied by little or no
pain; rim and base of the same are loose, red, rank,
and bleed easily. On the other hand syphilitic ulcers
are very painful and rim and base are covered with
greasy matter.</p>

<p>Lupus appears only in the form of knots, which
are deeply inbedded, from size of a pinhead to that
of a lentil, but never as large knots in the beginning.
Syphilis produces large and palpable knots
from the start.</p>

<p>Loss of the bony part of the nose or destruction
of the hard palate are observed, but rarely and after
protracted existence of lupus, and often in the case of
syphilis.</p>

<p>The indicated peculiarities however refer only to
typical cases of lupus and of syphilis. In other cases
it was almost impossible to show a difference.</p>

<p>As regards the course of lupus, the same begins,
as has been stated before, in earliest childhood, sometimes
only in the form of scaly spots and knots.
Less often lupus developes after complete development<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
of manhood. It is more frequent with women
than with men. Sometimes some of the knots remain
isolated and disappear again after a time; in other
cases additions appear in the course of time, which
may affect larger portions of the body and lead to
more or less dangerous ulcers. As a rule the course
of lupus, even of great extent, is not malignant and
at the most the alliance with <i>traumatic erysipelas</i>
and possibly the appearance of <i>pulmonary consumption</i>
may succeed the affliction. In cases of
not too rare occurrence it has been observed that
lupus has developed into <i>cancer</i>, which has always
resulted fatally.</p>

<p>The <i>treatment</i> of lupus has principally been a
<i>local</i> one. Caustics were applied to destroy lupous
tubercles by direct action, and furthermore recourse
has been taken to the so-called mechanical treatment,
in which the ringworm was scraped out.</p>

<p>Our experiences relating to the mechanical treatment
of lupus have taught us the following.</p>

<p>Lupus can not be cured without destroying and
removing the diseased and affected tissue. That
method which effects the most radical destruction,
protects most from relapses. Therefore the best
method of treating lupus is to cut out the diseased
skin. But with the superficial spreading peculiar to
many cases of lupus this method can only be applied<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
within certain limits. Then again the secondary
growths after an operation may be of serious consequences.</p>

<p>Unfortunately it has not been possible before this
to remove all diseased portions, no matter what
method was applied, because often tiny lupous tubercles
spring up which are almost invisible to the
naked eye. These tubercles will again be the starting
point for another spreading of lupus.</p>

<p>We will see that Koch's new method to cure has
the advantage both to make visible all tubercles,
even those that have escaped our notice and also to
effect a cure in the shortest time even in old chronic
cases that have before this been considered incurable.
It is especially possible in this form of tuberculosis
to follow the specific action of the new remedy, as we
will learn later on.</p>

<p><i>Tuberculosis of the testicles</i> is not so very rare,
it is found in about 2<small><sup>1</sup></small>&frasl;<small><sub>2</sub></small> per cent. of all men afflicted
with pulmonary consumption. It is more rarely met
with in children than in men.</p>

<p>The conditions under which tuberculosis of the
testicles and epididymis developes are various inflammatory
processes with existing disposition. It
is mostly gonorrhea or some other inflammation of
the urethra, or injured testicle. It occurs less frequently
without any apparent cause.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>According to the starting point of tuberculosis
the symptoms are varied. If it starts in the testicle,
this appears normal or larger in size, but never
reaches extraordinary dimensions. The surface of
the testicle is at first smooth in the case of increased
tension, later only does it become irregular, bumpy
and of unequal consistency.</p>

<p>If the starting point is in the epididymis, hard,
rounded lumps are formed generally in the head or
tail of the epididymis, rarely in the body. These
increase in size and cause a swelling often of extraordinary
dimensions, the surface of which appears
hard, irregular, bumpy and in certain parts yielding
and elastic. If the process is extended to the testicle,
this also increases in size. Then both together form
an oval swollen mass and can not be distinguished
from each other.</p>

<p>Striking changes appear only later and consist
in the softening of the lumps and in the development
of abscesses.</p>

<p>Very soon the lobuli are affected. The same are
then thickened in the septa, are hard and form an
irregular, bumpy swelling surrounded by more or
less thickened tissue.</p>

<p>Very soon tuberculous changes are caused in the
prostate gland, an organ situated near the intestine
and the functions of which are to dilute the semen.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
A hardening is often the first sign, this is followed by
increase in size and then softening.</p>

<p>With the affection of the prostate gland, that of
the urethra also begins, which passes through the
middle of the prostate gland. This disease often
appears in the form of a yellowish secretion, which is
more and more increased and becomes ichorous with
the decay of the urethra and the prostate gland.
This secretion must be distinguished from that which
as a venereal affection caused the whole process.
The tubercular derangements do not only extend forward
but also upward. The bladder, the ureters
and the kidneys are affected and show extreme
derangements with altered urinal secretions and
excretions.</p>

<p>Of other symptoms of tuberculosis of the testicles
pain deserves especial mention. The same is slight
in the beginning, but often becomes insufferable.</p>

<p>The symptoms here related often increase very
slowly. Essential changes are caused during the
chronic course of tuberculosis of the testicles if suppuration
sets in. The skin is perforated and fistulae
are formed. If there is no halt in the process,
general tuberculosis results and this has until now
always caused death.</p>

<p>According to the time in which the general
derangements come about, a chronic and acute<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
tuberculosis of the testicles has been distinguished.
The former is the more frequent, the latter of rare
occurrence.</p>

<p>The sexual functions may remain unchanged if
only one testicle is diseased, but are generally ruined
if both epididymes are affected, because the secretion
of the semen is then interrupted by the stopping up
of the vas deferens. In some cases the sexual function
may be interrupted for a time only and may
then be resumed.</p>

<p>The treatment before this has been surgical, in
which the diseased parts were carefully removed, and
where this was impossible, even castration (removal
of the testicle) was performed. Without doubt
Koch's method will cause great changes in the
method of treatment here also.</p>

<p>Finally we must include in our reflection the well-known
disease of children, <i>scrofula</i>. Although the
same is not a form of tuberculosis in the sense of the
diseases just considered, still tuberculosis and scrofula
have the most intimate relations. Scrofula is
only too often a precursory stage of tuberculosis.</p>

<p>The manifold scrofulous affections, such as inflamed
eyes, diseased ears, skin diseases, catarrh of
the nose, pharynx or bronchials, inflammation of
the joints and suppuration are not caused through
the cooperation of tubercle-bacilli. But here the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
same find an excellent soil for growth and propagation,
and they use the same to the full extent and so
give the impetus for the development of tuberculosis.</p>

<p>Scrofula is one of the most frequent diseases,
it is spread over the whole world. It occurs more
seldom in the tropics than in the north. Furthermore
it is more frequent in a cold and damp climate
than in a dry one. Elevation has no influence on the
development of this disease. Scrofulous individuals
are found in the mountains as well as in the plains.</p>

<p>Scrofula principally attacks children; it occurs
most frequently in the time from the second to the
fifteenth year. Rarely earlier developed scrofula
drags beyond the age of puberty or more advanced
manhood. Sex has no particular influence on the
development of scrofula.</p>

<p>In many cases this particular disease is <i>inherited</i>.
The following causes are considered in the inheritance
of scrofula: great age, close relationship and
infirmity of the parents; but the germ of scrofula is
planted in the child by parents that are themselves
afflicted with tuberculosis or scrofula. This is most
frequently observed in children that have descended
from parents, who were scrofulous in their youth
and remained so, or that became tuberculous later
on and at the time of generation were afflicted by
advanced scrofula or tuberculosis, or that were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
suffering from oft-treated but never entirely cured
syphilis. Some scientists claim to have observed the
inheritance of scrofula by children, whose parents at
the time of generation were afflicted with tuberculosis
or were suffering from general debility resulting from
hunger and want.</p>

<p>In the majority of cases scrofula is acquired, as a
rule the development of this disease is favored by
indigence and poor hygienic conditions according to
the coinciding experience of all scientists; <i>nutrition</i>,
especially in the first year of life, has the greatest
influence on the origin of scrofula.</p>

<p>In <i>infancy</i> the most frequent cause of scrofula is
the premature giving of <i>farinaceous</i> food besides the
mother's milk, or the feeding of children with so-called
pap, especially when this is done in the <i>first
month of their life</i>.</p>

<p>In later months the excessive eating of bread,
potatoes or vegetables instead of milk has an injurious
effect.</p>

<p>Furthermore the development of scrofula is
favored by the breathing of <i>foul damp air</i> such as is
frequently found in newly built or damp houses and
also by <i>deficient care of the skin</i>.</p>

<p>Scrofula thrives in the narrow tenement dwellings
in which is found a close, overheated, foul air
pregnant with smoke, kitchen fumes and mustiness
from the damp walls.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>Frequently the development of scrofula has been
observed to succeed measles, diphtheria, scarlatina
or whooping-cough.</p>

<p>The opponents of vaccination also designate
vaccination as a frequent cause of scrofula. It is
supposed that a poison is transferred into the
system with the lymph which is enabled to generate
the phenomena of scrofula. However the supposition
has not as yet been proven.</p>

<p>Of course the fact cannot be denied, that cases
of developing scrofula have been at times observed
as succeeding vaccination. But the circumstances
are the same as in the case of the contagious diseases
mentioned above. No one will probably maintain
that in those cases in which the development of
scrofula had been succeeding those diseases, that
this has resulted from a poison generated by the preceding
disease.</p>

<p>The attempt to designate symptoms by which to
recognize a scrofulous constitution has at all times
been made. Many physicians have for a long time
distinguished a <i>torpid</i> and an <i>erethistic</i> scrofulous
constitution.</p>

<p>With a <i>torpid</i> constitution the body is pale,
spongy and bloated, the nose and lips are thick, the
abdomen swelled, there is plenty of fat and but weak
muscles. Such children are indolent, at times peevish
and indifferent, they do not sleep quietly, have no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
appetite or may be voracious and suffer from derangements
of digestion. An examination of all
organs indicates no change. The children are easily
afflicted with eruptions of the skin, with inflammation
of the eyes and ears, and catarrh of the mucous
membranes, which are characterized by great obstinacy.
The derangements in nutrition here described
are caused by the lymphatic glands though a swelling
of the same can not be found.</p>

<p>In the case of <i>erethistic</i> scrofula the children are
found to be of slight and lean structure, with fine
hair and long eyelashes; they are active, easily
excited, gifted and extremely sensitive to physical
pain. The face is pale and becomes easily flushed by
physical or emotional excitements. They are easily
subject to palpitation and short breath; and are
attacked by high fevers from the slightest reason.
The lymphatic glands, especially the deepseated ones,
are as a rule more or less swelled.</p>

<p>In most cases, however, the characteristics of
these two forms are blended.</p>

<p>The phenomena of scrofula are manifold and
extend over the entire body.</p>

<p>The <i>skin</i> is frequently the seat of scrofulous
affections. These are particularly found on the head
and face and are characterized by great obstinacy
and tendency to return.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>Most frequently herpes appear, the parts especially
affected are the scalp, face, auricular passages,
eyelids and the nose with its surrounding parts.</p>

<p>Pustules are sometimes developed under the skin
and may appear in great numbers. These pustules
may either break through the skin or shrink into a
caseous mass.</p>

<p>Of all <i>mucous membranes</i> that of the <i>nose</i>
becomes most frequently diseased; in a great number
of cases this happens in the form of a chronic
catarrh; the mucous membrane of the nose is reddened
and swollen and a profuse, thick, purulent,
ichorous and easily drying fluid is secreted. Often
the external parts of the nose are swollen as a result
of the catarrh and the nostrils are stopped up with
thick yellowish-green rinds. Inflammation of the skin
is caused by the flowing out of the purulent and
ichorous liquid secreted.</p>

<p>In many other cases the disease appears in the
form of scrofulous ulcers on the mucous membranes
of the nose; in such cases it is found that the nose is
stopped up with numerous yellowish brown crusts;
after removing the same the mucous membrane
appears swollen and moderately reddened, on several
places ulcers, the size of lentils, are found which are
covered with a yellowish gray coating. At the
slightest touch bleeding of the nose is caused; often<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
also the external parts are reddened and swollen.
In such cases erysipelas frequently developes, starting
from the nose and spreading over the whole
face. Frequently a repetition of erysipelas occurs.</p>

<p>The scrofulous catarrh just described is generally
of a very protracted nature and is marked by many
relapses. Sometimes the fluid secretion of the nose
is of very bad odor.</p>

<p>The mucous membrane of the <i>throat</i> becomes
diseased at the same time as that of the nose. The
same is found to be moderately reddened and
swollen; the lymphatic glands especially those on
the posterior wall of the throat are increased to
swellings the size as large as peas. The <i>tonsils</i> also
become inflamed frequently and become enlarged
through the repeated rather chronic inflammation.</p>

<p><i>Inflammations of the ear</i> are a common occurrence
with scrofula. These originate most frequently
by means of the eustachian tube, which connects the
ear with the back part of the mouth as a result of
the catarrh of the nose and throat. In a majority of
cases the inflammations of the ears lead to perforation
of the tympanum and may even result in fatal
cerebral meningitis.</p>

<p>The <i>eye</i> is as frequently affected by scrofula.
Swelling of the lids and inflammation of the glands
are the lighter forms. Pustules on the connective
tissue of the eye and on the cornea, accompanied<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
by photophobia, cramp in the lids and
flowing of tears are those severe forms that are so
frequently observed in scrofula, and that often leave
opaque and incurable spots on the cornea of the eye.</p>

<p>Swelling of the <i>glands</i> has at all times been a
characteristic phenomenon of scrofula. A swelling is
merely the result of diseases of the mucous membrane
of the throat or nose, of herpes of the scalp
or face, of inflammations of the ears, eyes, periosteum,
bones, etc. In the beginning the swelling of the
glands is painless and results in flat swellings of
about the size of filberts, which may be moved back
and forth; such glandular swellings may exist for
years, without showing the slightest alterations.</p>

<p>With renewed attacks they enlarge and may
become of considerable size. At times single glands
become inflamed, hurt when pressed and develop
abscesses which perforate the skin after it has
become inflamed and reddened.</p>

<p>These abscesses may heal within a few days. In
the majority of cases, however, they remain for a
longer period, months and even years and result in
the well-known tumid, hard and immovable scars.</p>

<p>Inflammation of the periosteum and of the bones
is one of the instances of scrofula. Most frequently
<i>spina ventosa</i> is found; the same consists of a
gradual, painless swelling of the diseased bones,
most frequently on the fingers and toes, so that they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
become bottle-shaped. The skin covering these
swellings is pale and tense. The swelling may
gradually disappear or begin to suppurate. Besides
this hip- and knee-joint inflammation are observed,
also inflammations of the ankle, elbow-joint, spine,
etc.; especially in the case of diseased bones it is
extremely difficult to fix a dividing line between
scrofula and tuberculosis.</p>

<p>The frequence of anaemia with scrofula is only a
<i>result</i> of the disease and not a symptom. As a
result of scrofula nutrition and assimilation become
impaired, mostly in the cases of extreme suppuration.</p>

<p>Scrofula is a chronic disease. In many cases it is
completely cured, the lighter cases after several
months and the more malignant after several years.
Extreme scrofula may often remain until puberty
and may be completely healed.</p>

<p><i>Fatal</i> results are due to scrofulously diseased
bones, joints or glands, and it can not be denied
that a large number of children succumb in this
manner. Fatal results may also be due to additional
diseases, such as pneumonia, pleurisy, intestinal
catarrh, etc.</p>

<p>It has been frequently observed that <i>tuberculosis</i>
succeeds scrofula. It is a well-known fact that
scrofula furnishes the largest contingent for tuberculosis.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>As a precautionary measure against scrofula a
careful regulation of the diet is recommended.
During the first nine months of life children should
be fed with human milk exclusively if possible. If
scrofula is hereditary in a family, or if the mother
exhibits symptoms of the disease, she should not be
allowed to nurse the child but a strong and healthy
nurse should be engaged. Recourse to artificial
nourishment must only then be taken, when nursing
the child is absolutely impossible. For this purpose
exceptionally pure cow's-milk ought to be
selected. All substitutes, that appear under various
names, such as infant's food, condensed milk, etc.,
contribute much toward the development of
scrofula.</p>

<p>Children 1&ndash;2 years of age are to be fed with
milk, meat and eggs. Only strong children, that
show no sign of scrofula may be fed once or twice a
day with small quantities of rice, tapioca, sago,
green vegetables, pulse, etc., beside the food above
mentioned.</p>

<p>To prevent scrofula it is essential not to give the
food of adults to children during the first years of life;
avoid exclusively solid food and prepare the same in
a pappy form as much as possible. Of course a
proper regulation of meal-time and a careful avoidance
of overfeeding is by all means to be observed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>It is of no less importance for a successful treatment
of scrofula to provide surroundings of as
favorable conditions as possible.</p>

<p>First of all <i>pure air</i> containing plenty of <i>oxygen</i>.
Therefore the <i>sea-coast</i> is recommended as a proper
place for scrofulous children. The children ought to
stay there until the signs of scrofula have disappeared
and the entire nutrition has been improved. The
results obtained in the sanitary stations (vacation
colonies) along the sea-shore for scrofulous children
have received much favorable comment.</p>

<p><i>Mountain air</i> has a similarly favorable effect
especially when <i>salt water baths</i> are used at the
same time; even the plain, pure <i>country air</i> proves
beneficial to scrofulous children. <i>Very dry</i> locations
and dwellings ought to be selected. The children
should remain <i>out of doors</i> as much as possible.</p>

<p>Of great importance for scrofulous children,
furthermore, is a suitable course in <i>gymnastics and
rubbing-down with cold water</i>. To begin with the
water may be 72&deg; but should gradually be reduced
to the natural temperature of well water.</p>

<p>Just how far Koch's new method will take the
place of former remedies used for scrofula can not be
told at present as experiments in this direction are
wanting. Nevertheless it will be possible to prevent
the dangerous transition of scrofula into tuberculosis
and thus save the lives of a great many persons.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>Anyone who has informed himself through the
foregoing as to the great number of diseases and
forms of disease that are directly or indirectly
connected with tuberculosis, will now be able to
estimate the farreaching import of Koch's discovery.
It will now be clear to him that pulmonary consumption
constitutes only a part, although a great
part of tuberculosis and that there are a great many
diseases besides that can now be surely cured, it is
hoped, with the aid of Koch's method. But this
much should be remembered by everyone that this
remedy also acts best and surest during the <i>beginning</i>
of a disease. We hope that no one will allow
valuable time to slip unimproved; it may easily
happen that it is too late for successful treatment.
Everyone will be able to recognize the symptoms of
diseases, which Koch has taught to cure, from the
foregoing complete description, and it is better to
apply the remedy once too often than miss the
proper time for application.</p>

<p>Koch's first communications relating to the
subject have just been published and will be given
unabridged in the following pages. As these communications
are written for physicians we will add
such explanatory notes as are deemed essential for
general intelligence.</p>

TUBERCULOSIS,</h2>

<p class="center" style="margin-top:2em; margin-bottom:2em; line-height:2.5em;">BY<br />Prof. R. KOCH, Berlin.</p>


<p>In a lecture, delivered by me several months ago,
at the International Medical Congress, I referred
to a remedy, which makes animal subjects impervious
to the inoculation of Tubercle-bacilli, and in the
case of diseased animals, checks the progress of the
tuberculous disease. In the meantime experiments
have been made with human subjects, about which I
will report in the following.</p>

<p>Originally I intended to complete my investigations
and especially gain sufficient experience concerning
the practical application of the remedy and
its production on a larger scale before I published
anything concerning it. In spite of all precautions
too much has already been published about it, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_c2" id="Page_c2">[c2]</a></span>
that distorted and exaggerated, so that I was obliged,
in a way, to prevent false conceptions, to give
even now a synopsis of the method as far as it has
progressed at the time being. Under present circumstances
it must necessarily be short and leave unanswered
many important questions.</p>

<p>The experiments have been, and are still being
made under my direction by Dr.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;Libbertz and
Stabsarzt Dr.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;Pfuhl. The necessary subjects and
material have been provided by Prof.&nbsp;Brieger from
his Polyclinic, Dr.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;Levy in his Private Surgical
Clinic, Geheimrath Fraentzel and Oberstabsarzt R.&nbsp;Koehler
in the Charite-Hospital, and Geheimrath
Herr v.&nbsp;Bergmann in the Surgical University Clinic.
To all these gentlemen and their assistants I here
tender my heartfelt thanks for their untiring interest
which they manifested for this subject and also for
the disinterested help and aid which they have offered
at all times and without which it would have been
impossible for me to make such progress in a few
months in this difficult and responsible investigation.</p>

<p>As my work is far from being completed, I can
not as yet make any statements relating to the
origin and preparation of this remedy and reserve
these for some future time.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>The curative is composed of a clear brown fluid,
which in itself is not perishable, even without special<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_c3" id="Page_c3">[c3]</a></span>
precautionary measures. For use this fluid must be
more or less diluted and these dilutions are perishable
when made with distilled water; Bacterian vegetation
soon develops in them and they become turbid
and are no longer fit for use. To prevent this the
dilutions must be sterilized through heat and be kept
under cotton batting or be prepared with a 5 per
cent. phenol solution which is much simpler. Through
repeated heating as also through the mixture with the
phenol the efficiency of the diluted solution appears
to be curtailed after a time and for that reason I
have always used solutions as fresh as possible.</p>

<p>The remedy does not act through the stomach;
to effect a reliable action it must be applied subcutaneously.
For our experiments we have exclusively
used a syringe decided upon by myself for
bacteriological purposes, which is supplied with a
small india-rubber ball and which has no stamp.
Such a syringe can be easily kept positively aseptic
by rinsing with absolutely pure alcohol and on this
we base the fact that not a single abscess has sprung
from over a thousand injections.</p>

<p>After trying various parts of the body as places
for application we selected the skin of the back
between the shoulderblades and in the lumbar
region, because at these places the injection was
almost painless and caused the least and in most
cases no local reaction.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_c4" id="Page_c4">[c4]</a></span>Even at the beginning of our experiments we
found that in one particularly important point the
human subject was affected by the curative in a way
decidedly differing from that of the animal subject
generally used, the guinea pig. Therefore another
confirmation of the rule for experimentors upon
which hardly enough stress can be laid, not to rely
upon a like effect upon the human being from the experiments
on the animal without further confirmatory
inquiry.</p>

<p>Man proved himself much more sensitive to the
effects of the remedy than the guinea pig. Up to
two cubic centimeters and even more of the undiluted
fluid could be injected under the skin of a healthy
guinea pig without causing any particularly disparaging
effect. In the case of a fullgrown man on the
other hand, 25&nbsp;ccm. are sufficient to produce intense
results. In proportion to weight of body therefore
<small><sup>1</sup></small>&frasl;<small><sub>1500</sub></small> of the amount which has no noticeable effect on
the guinea pig has a decidedly strong effect on the
man.</p>

<p>From an injection that I have made on my upper
arm I have experienced the symptoms which arise in
man after an injection of 25&nbsp;ccm., in short they were
the following: Three or four hours after the injection
a raking pain in the joints, languor, inclination to
cough, oppressed breathing, which rapidly increased;
in the fifth hour I experienced intense chills which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_c5" id="Page_c5">[c5]</a></span>
lasted nearly an hour, at the same time nausea,
vomiting, increase of the temperature of the body to
39.6&deg;&nbsp;C. After about 12 hours all these affectations
ceased. The temperature sank and reached the
normal height the next day. Heaviness of the limbs
and languor lasted for a few more days, and for the
same length of time the place of injection remained
red and painful.</p>

<p>The lower limit of effect of the curative for a
healthy man is about .01&nbsp;ccm. (= 1 cubic centimeter
diluted with a 100 parts) as numerous trials
have shown. The majority reacted on this dose with
only light pain in the joints and passing languor.
With a few a slight rise in temperature set in, to
38&deg;&nbsp;C. or a trifle higher.</p>

<p>Although there is a marked difference as regards
the dose of the curative (according to relative weight
of body) between the animal subject and man, an
evident resemblance is shown in several other
qualities.</p>

<p>The most important of these qualities is <i>the
specific action of this remedy on tuberculous processes
of whatever kind they may be</i>. I will
not relate the effects on the animal subject in
this connection, as it would lead too far, but will
at once turn to the peculiar effects on tuberculous
human beings.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_c6" id="Page_c6">[c6]</a></span>As we have seen, a healthy man reacts but little
or not at all on .01&nbsp;ccm. The same is true of diseased
persons, provided they are not tuberculous. But the
relations are entirely different with those afflicted
with tuberculosis; a marked general and also a local
reaction resulted from an injection of the same
dose of the remedy (.01&nbsp;ccm.)<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>.</p>

<p>The general reaction consists of an attack of
fever, which, beginning mostly with chills, raises the
temperature to over 39&deg;, often up to 40&deg; and even
41&deg;. Other noticeable symptoms are pains in the
joints, a tendency to cough, great languor, and often
nausea and vomiting. Several times we observed a
faint icteric coloring and in some cases the appearance
on neck and breast of an exanthema resembling
measles. As a rule the attack begins 4&ndash;5 hours
after the injection and lasts 12&ndash;15 hours. In exceptional
cases it may begin much later, but then it is
not nearly so intense. The patients experience remarkably
little weakness from the attack and feel
relatively well as soon as it is over, generally better
than they did before it came on.</p>

<p>The local reaction can best be observed on those
patients whose tuberculose affection is plainly visible,
for instance those afflicted with lupus. In them
changes take place that prove the specific antitubercular
action of the remedy in a most surprising way.
The diseased portions of the skin in the face, etc.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_c7" id="Page_c7">[c7]</a></span>
begin to swell and turn red even before the attack of
chills set in, although the injection is made under the
skin of the back, a point decidedly remote from the
affected parts. The swelling and reddening increases
during the fever and can attain a very marked degree
so that the lupus-tissue turns reddish brown
and necrotic. In the case of more sharply defined
lupus centres the more swollen and dark red parts
were edged by a white seam nearly a centimeter wide
and this again was surrounded by a wide bright red
border. The swelling of the diseased parts gradually
decreases after the cession of fever and may
have entirely disappeared after 2 or 3 days. A
serum exudes from these lupus-centres and, drying,
forms a crust on them which changes into scabs that
fall off in 2&ndash;3 weeks and sometimes leave a smooth
red scar after a single injection. Generally several
injections are necessary to effect a complete removal
of the lupose tissue, but of this I will speak further
on. It is very important to note that the changes
during this process are exclusively limited to the
portions of the skin affected by lupus; even the
faintest and smallest bits of diseased tissue go
through the entire process and become visible on
account of their swelling and reddening, while the
actual scab-tissue in which the various stages of
lupus have been completed remains unchanged.</p>

<p>The observation of the treatment of lupus with
the remedy is so instructive and must be so convincing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_c8" id="Page_c8">[c8]</a></span>
as regards the specific nature of the remedy
that every one wishing to occupy himself with the
study of this remedy should if possible make his first
experiments with lupus.</p>

<p>Less marked, but still apparent to the eye and
touch are the local reactions in tuberculosis of
the lymphatic glands, of the bones and joints, etc.,
in which case swelling and increased painfulness,
and in the more superficial parts also a reddening
can be observed.</p>

<p>The reaction in the inner organs, especially
the lungs is removed from our observation unless we
consider the increased coughing and expectoration
of the patients after the first injection a local reaction.
At the same time we must assume that
these parts undergo changes directly observed in the
case of lupus.</p>

<p>The different forms of reaction described have
appeared without exception in previous trials on the
dose of .01&nbsp;ccm. when any form of tuberculosis
prevailed in the system, and therefore I trust that
I am justified in assuming, that in the future this
remedy will constitute an indispensible diagnostic
auxiliary. We will be enabled to diagnose in doubtful
cases of phthisis even then, when it is impossible
to obtain reliable information concerning the nature
of the ailment, by the presence of bacilli or elastic
fibres in the sputum or by a physical examination.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_c9" id="Page_c9">[c9]</a></span>
Glandular affectations, hidden tuberculosis of the
bones, doubtful tuberculosis of the skin and the like
will easily and reliably prove to be such. In case of
apparently completed processes of tuberculosis of
the lungs or joints it will be possible to show
whether the process of the disease is in reality a
complete one or establish the existence of centres
from which later on the disease may spread like a
fire from a live coal in the ashes.</p>

<p>But much more important are the specific qualities
of the remedy than the aids it offers for the
diagnosis.</p>

<p>While describing the changes, that are caused by
hypodermic injections of the remedy, on the parts
of the skin affected by lupus, attention was called to
the fact that the lupose tissue does not return to its
original condition after the swelling and reddening
have ceased, but is more or less destroyed and disappears.
On some places, as observation teaches,
the process is such, that after a single injection the
diseased tissues undergo mortification and are cast
off as dead matter later on. On other places it
seems that a diminution or rather a kind of melting
of the tissue is caused, and to effect a complete disappearance
a repeated application of the remedy is
necessary. As the required histological investigation
is wanting, it is impossible at the present time
to state with certainty how this result is brought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_c10" id="Page_c10">[c10]</a></span>
about. Only this much is known that it is not a
destruction of the tubercle bacilli, but that only the
tissue containing the tubercular bacilli is affected by
the application of the remedy. In this, as the visible
swelling and reddening show, greater circulatory derangements
are caused and with these vital changes
in the <i>assimilation</i> which result in a more or
less rapid and thorough mortification of the
tissue according to the manner in which the remedy
is allowed to act.</p>

<p>To make a short repetition, the remedy therefore
does not destroy the tubercle bacilli, but the tuberculous
tissue; on dead tissue, for instance, gangrenous
cheesy matter, necrotic bones, etc., it does not act;
nor on tissue that has undergone mortification
through the action of the remedy itself. Living
bacilli can still linger in such dead masses of tissue,
which are either cast out with the necrotic tissue, or
may possibly migrate under special conditions into
the adjoining living tissue.</p>

<p>This quality of the remedy must be particularly
observed, if its full specific action is to be obtained.
Therefore we must first cause the mortification of
the tuberculous tissue, and then effect its removal as
soon as possible, for instance, by means of a surgical
operation; but where this is impossible and the
excretion by the organisms themselves is necessarily
slow, we must attempt by continued application of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_c11" id="Page_c11">[c11]</a></span>
the remedy to protect the endangered living tissue
from the immigration of the parasites.</p>

<p>As the remedy acts only on living tissue and
causes mortification of tuberculous tissue, we can
readily explain another exceedingly peculiar property
of the remedy, namely, that it can be given in
rapidly increased doses. This may apparently be
explained as being based on inurement. But noting
that in about three weeks the dose may be increased
to 500 times the strength of the first one, it is
unquestionably something more than habit, as we
know of nothing analogous confirming such a rapid
and farreaching adaptation to any powerful drug.</p>

<p>This fact can rather be explained thus: in the
beginning there is an abundance of living tuberculous
tissue and only a minute quantity of the
effective substance is sufficient to cause a strong
reaction; through each injection a certain quantity
of this responsive tissue disappears, and then relatively
larger doses are required to cause the same
degree of reaction as before. Aside from this adaptation
may assert itself within certain limits. As
soon as the patient is treated with such increased
doses, and that he reacts no more than one not afflicted
with tuberculosis, we may assume that all the
reactive tuberculous tissue is dead. It is then only
necessary to continue the treatment at intervals and
with gradually increased doses as long as any bacilli<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_c12" id="Page_c12">[c12]</a></span>
remain in the system, to protect the patient from a
new infection.</p>

<p>It remains to be learnt in the future whether this
conception and the deductions based thereon are
correct. For the present I have directed the manner
of application of the remedy on this basis, which in
our experiments resulted as follows:</p>

<p>To begin again with the simplest case, namely
lupus, we injected the full dose of .01&nbsp;ccm. in nearly
all such patients to begin with, and allowed the
reaction to take its full course, after 1&ndash;2 weeks we
again injected .01&nbsp;ccm. and so forth until the reaction
became less and less and finally ceased. In the
case of two patients with facial lupus three respectively
four injections in this manner resulted in a
clean, smooth scar in place of the affected parts; the
remaining patients of this kind have also improved
in a measure proportioned to the time of treatment.
All the patients have suffered from their afflictions
for years and have been treated by various methods
without success.</p>

<p>Tuberculosis of the glands, bones and joints has
been treated in a very similar manner, as in these
cases larger doses were applied at longer intervals.
The result was the same as with lupus, a rapid cure in
the lighter and milder cases and a slowly progressing
improvement in the severer ones.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_c13" id="Page_c13">[c13]</a></span>With the majority of our patients, those suffering
from pulmonary consumption, the conditions
are somewhat different, patients with decided pulmonary
tuberculosis are very much more responsive
to this remedy, than those afflicted with surgical
tubercles. We were forced to reduce the quantity of
the first dose of .01&nbsp;ccm. as prepared for the
phthisicist, and we found that as a rule he reacted
strongly on a dose of .002 and even .001&nbsp;ccm.,
but that the quantity could be rapidly increased
from this low initial dose to that which could be
easily tolerated by the other patients. We generally
proceeded in such a manner that the patient at first
received an injection of .001&nbsp;ccm. and if a rise in the
temperature set in this dose was repeated once daily
until the reaction ceased. Only then the dose was
increased to .002&nbsp;ccm. and applied till the reactions
failed to appear. And so forth, always increasing
the dose only .001 or at the most .002 up to .01&nbsp;ccm.
and higher. This mild procedure seemed to me
imperative, especially with such patient as were in a
weak and feeble condition. Proceeding in the
manner just described we can easily attain the application
of very light doses with but slight attacks of
fever and hardly perceptible to the patient. Some of
the stronger consumptives were treated with larger
doses from the beginning, partly with a forced increase
in the dosing when it seemed as though the
favorable result was obtained in a correspondingly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_c14" id="Page_c14">[c14]</a></span>
shorter time. The action of the remedy on the
phthisicist generally seemed to be such that cough
and expectoration increased somewhat after the first
injection, then gradually diminished and in favorable
cases disappeared entirely; the sputum lost its
purulent nature and became slimy. The number of
bacilli as a rule did not decrease until the sputum
had attained a phlegmy appearance (only such
patients were selected for these experiments in whose
expectorations bacilli were contained). They entirely
disappeared temporarily, but were again met with
from time to time until the expectoration had completely
stopped. At the same time the night-sweats
left off, and the patients improved in appearance
and gained in weight. All patients treated in the
first stages of phthisis were freed from all symptoms
of disease in the course of 4&ndash;6 weeks so that they
could be considered as cured. Even patients with
cavities not too large were considerably improved
and nearly healed. But in the case of such consumptives,
whose lungs contained many and large cavities
no objective improvement could be marked,
although the expectoration diminished and they
appeared to feel much better. I am inclined to
assume on the basis of these experiences, that the
<i>earliest stages of phthisis can with certainty
be cured by this remedy</i>.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> This may also hold
good in cases that are not too far advanced.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_c15" id="Page_c15">[c15]</a></span>In exceptional cases only will pulmonary consumptives,
with large cavities, derive continued
benefits through the application of the remedy, when
other complications exist, for instance, the penetration
of other supurative micro-organisms, irremovable
pathological changes in other organs, etc. Even
such patients were in most cases temporarily improved.
It must follow that even in them the
original process of the disease, tuberculosis, is
influenced in the same manner by this remedy as in
other patients, but that it is impossible to remove
the gangrenous masses of tissue and also the secondary
supurative processes. Naturally we are led to think
that perhaps in some of these severe cases cures may
be effected by means of a combination of this healing
process together with surgical aid (after the manner
of operating empyema) or some other curative
means. I would not advise anyone however, to
apply this remedy without discrimination in every
case of tuberculosis. The simplest mode of application
will certainly be required in treating the first
stages of phthisis and simple surgical affections, but
in all other forms of tuberculosis medical science
should draw on all its resources and individualize
carefully to supplement and sustain the action of the
remedy. In many cases I have had the decided impression
that the attendance to and nursing of the
patient was of no little influence on the curative
process, and therefore I would prefer the application<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_c16" id="Page_c16">[c16]</a></span>
of the remedy in suitably adapted institutions, where
a close observation of the patient and the adequate
attention to them is possible, to the ambulant or
home treatment. No estimate can at present be
made as to the extent in which a profitable combination
can be made between this new method to cure
and those modes of treatment that have thus far
been considered beneficial, the application of mountain
climate, the free air treatment, specific nourishment,
etc.; but I trust, that these remedial factors
will be of considerable use in conjunction with the
new method in many cases, especially the severe
and neglected as also in the convalescent stages.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>The nucleus of this new curative method lies in
the earliest possible application. The proper
objects of treatment ought to be the first stages of
phthisis, because here the remedy can fully develop
its curative qualifications. Therefore it is of vital
importance, more so in the future, than it has been
in the past, that practical physicians employ all
possible means to diagnosticate phthisis in as early a
stage as possible. Until lately the finding of tubercle
bacilli existing in the sputum was rather considered
as an interesting incidental evidence, which, although
it insured the diagnosis, was of no further benefit to
the patient and therefore was only too often omitted,
as I have only lately discovered in numerous
cases of phthisis which had passed through the
hands of several physicians without having their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_c17" id="Page_c17">[c17]</a></span>
sputum examined once. This must be different in
the future. Any physician who fails to search for
tubercle bacilli in the sputum, to establish phthisis
in as early a stage as possible, commits gross
negligence toward his patient, because his life may
depend on this diagnosis and the specific treatment
which has hurriedly been introduced on this basis.
In doubtful cases the physician should gain certainty
as to the existence or absence of tuberculosis
through a trial injection.</p>

<p>Only then will the new mode of treatment truly
become a panacea for suffering mankind when that
period is reached, where all cases of tuberculosis are
treated in as early a stage as possible, to prevent
the development of neglected severer cases which
have heretofore formed a continual unlimited source
of new infection.</p>

<p>In conclusion I would remark, that I have intentionally
omitted all numerical statistics and descriptions
of individual cases in this communication,
because the physicians to whose material the patients
provided for our experiments belonged, have themselves
undertaken the description of their respective
cases and I did not wish to anticipate them in an
objective representation of their observations.</p>

<h2><a name="Explanatory_Notes" id="Explanatory_Notes"></a>Explanatory Notes.</h2>


<p>Koch states that he can not at the present make
any statement about the origin and preparation of
the remedy, as his labors are not yet completed.</p>

<p>We may assume that it is very probably a substance
that corresponds in a way to the lymph used
for vaccination. As vaccine lymph represents variolous
poison greatly reduced in strength, as the
remedy for hydrophobia is composed of a substance
which is weakened hydrophobic poison, so Koch
probably obtains his remedy for tuberculosis by
artificially reducing the tuberculous poison by means
of various processes.</p>

<p>A number of years ago it has been tried with
syphilis in a similar way to obtain a substance that
would not only cure syphilis but would also guard
against infection from it. At that time however the
experiment was not successful.</p>

<p>From several intimations I am inclined to believe
that Koch was successful in finding a way in which a
substance may be produced for contagious diseases,
a substance that cures these diseases and also protects
from infection. It is not impossible, since
Jenner found the vaccine virus, Pasteur the hydrophobic
lymph and now Koch the tubercle lymph.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_c20" id="Page_c20">[c20]</a></span>To be sure there is this difference for the present
between the substances named, that the vaccine
virus only protects healthy person from infection by
small pox but it does not cure those sick, while the
hydrophobic lymph and tubercle lymph cure the
afflicted. However Koch seems to believe that his
tubercle lymph has a certain power of producing
immunity.</p>

<p>According to Koch, his remedy, consisting of a
brownish liquid, is easily perishable as soon as it is
diluted with water; he recommends the preparation
of the dilution of the remedy with a 5 per cent.
phenol solution. Phenol is equivalent to carbolic
acid. The dilution of the remedy for use must be
considerable, as only small quantities of the same
are used.</p>

<p>Koch tells us that his remedy does not act
through the stomach, that is taken in through the
mouth. On one hand it may be that this is due to
the extremely small quantities necessary for an
effect, on the other hand and principally all the substances
probably act only when they are directly
applied and brought in contact with the circulation
of the blood.</p>

<p>For a long time small syringes with fine needle
points were used to inject strong acting drugs under
the skin. This is done in a measure to have a
guarantee of a sure effect which is not had by giving<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_c21" id="Page_c21">[c21]</a></span>
through the mouth. For instance, it is known that
emetics given through the mouth often remain without
results; if however the emetic apomorphine is
injected anywhere under the skin, vomiting surely
follows within a very short time. It is well known
that morphine is injected under the skin in preference
to taking it through the mouth as its action as a
pain killer is much prompter.</p>

<p>Koch's liquid can also be injected under the skin
with the aid of a so-called Pravaz syringe. Koch
uses a somewhat differently formed syringe. The
result remains the same, no matter what kind of
syringe is used.</p>

<p>At the same time it makes but little difference,
on what part of the body the injection is made, as
the fluid injected under the skin is distributed at
once over the entire system. Koch chose the skin
of the back between the shoulderblades and the
loins because here the injection could be made without
causing pain or inflammation.</p>

<p>The production of the liquid must be attended
with great difficulties as Koch plainly remarks that
his stock at present is very limited and he can only
furnish larger quantities at the end of several weeks.
The price of a small bottle to be 25&ndash;30 Marks about
6&ndash;8 Dollars.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_c22" id="Page_c22">[c22]</a></span>The human being is much more sensitive to
Koch's remedy than the guinea pig, which is commonly
used for experiments of this kind. It seems
that no experiments have as yet been made with
other animals.</p>

<p>Koch has tried the remedy on himself and has
passed through all the symptoms of a poisoning.
He certainly injected into his arm a considerable
quantity of the liquid; twenty-five times as much as
he injected in his patients.</p>

<p>But here also there is a difference. In sick
people much smaller quantities act than in the
healthy. One cubic centimeter of the liquid has
hardly any effect on a healthy person, but quite a
marked one on those afflicted with tuberculosis.</p>

<p>In the case of the latter one cubic centimeter produces
about the same symptoms as twenty-five times
the quantity would in a healthy person. The same
must also be considered as symptoms of poisoning;
but they are only of short duration and are accompanied
with magnificent success.</p>

<p>Of all diseases based on tuberculosis only ringworm
or lupus is perceivable by the eye, as it is a
disease of the skin, all other tuberculous diseases
take their course in the internal parts of the body,
and therefore are not perceptible to the eye. The
symptoms that follow an injection of Koch's liquid
can be best observed in the case of lupus.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_c23" id="Page_c23">[c23]</a></span>Koch therefore selected for his first illustration
patients afflicted with lupus that is ringworm. Even
a few hours after the injection the first perceptible
changes begin to show in the diseased parts. These
begin to swell and redden; in other words an inflammation
is caused, through which the diseased tissue
is obviously brought to mortification. Soon the inflammation
stops. The gangrenous tissue changes
into crusts or scabs which drop off in a short time
and the patient is cured of his ringworm.</p>

<p>Koch places particular importance on the fact
that the inflammation is restricted to the diseased
parts only, and that it does not attack sound and
healthy parts. Even the smallest otherwise invisible
knots are made perceptible through the inflammation.</p>

<p>We have similar illustrations for this specific
action of Koch's remedy for lupus (ringworm). So
for instance a syphilitic ulcer on the thigh may be
cured in a few days with iodide of potassium. In a
similar manner a morbidly enlarged spleen may be
reduced to the normal size by taking quinine.</p>

<p>The observation is very interesting indeed, as
it may be shown whether a person is tuberculous in
any organ or not by the injection of .01&nbsp;ccm. In case
he is tuberculous the poisoning symptoms appear in
a marked degree; if he is not, hardly any effect is
noticeable.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_c24" id="Page_c24">[c24]</a></span>Although we have had excellent methods for a
long time to detect pulmonary consumption, although
Koch added the discovery of the tubercle
bacilli, it occasionally happens that the disease can
not be recognized in its beginning stages, because its
progress is too slight. Now the reaction following
an injection is to be the deciding medium. Also with
other tuberculous affections physicians will welcome
this diagnostic auxiliary, for in the beginning of the
same it often happens that no certain diagnosis
could be made and valuable time was lost.</p>

<p>We must call particular attention to the further
statements of Koch, that through his remedy the
tubercle bacilli are <i>not</i> killed. With this it is admitted
that the remedy will not be able to effect cures,
without any more ado, yes, even the tubercle bacilli
may continue to infect parts of the body even in
spite of the action of the remedy.</p>

<p>Therefore the application of Koch's remedy only,
is not sufficient to effect a cure. Provision must be
made to remove the gangrenous tissue from the body
as rapidly as possible, because it contains the still
living tubercle bacilli. As a rule surgical aid is necessary
to remove the mortified tissue. Where this
is impossible Koch advises the continued application
of the remedy to protect the endangered living tissue
from the re-immigration of the tubercle bacilli. Koch<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_c25" id="Page_c25">[c25]</a></span>
thereby believes that he can protect the tissue,
perhaps in the manner as vaccination protects from
small pox.</p>

<p>The rapid increase in the quantity of the remedy
applied in the course of time is something that has
no parallel. Koch gives an explanation, but leaves
it to the future to be confirmed. We have no previous
instance in case that his explanation should prove
correct. Reasoning from analogous application of our
remedy, we are led to assume that <i>smaller</i> quantities
of the substance would suffice to cause mortification
of the remaining tuberculous tissue. Koch on the
other hand uses larger and larger doses to reach a
result. He admits inurement to the remedy within
certain limits only.</p>

<p>Koch has made a difference between pulmonary
consumptives and those suffering from tuberculosis
of the bones and joints, etc. He was able to inject
larger quantities in the latter than the former, for
the quantity injected in the case of pulmonary consumptives
was .001&nbsp;ccm.; in other tuberculous cases
.01&nbsp;ccm.</p>

<p>Koch selected pulmonary consumptives for his
experiments, whose sputum contained tubercle bacilli,
so as to make no error in the diagnosis, and to ascertain
by killing the bacilli contained in the sputum,
whether the diseased tend toward restoration. As
the remedy does not kill the bacilli, so a diminution<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_c26" id="Page_c26">[c26]</a></span>
of the bacilli can only be obtained in that manner,
that the tissue of the lungs undergoes certain changes,
which cause its properties to be such, that the bacilli
are no longer able to exist or propagate in them.
Then a so-called immunity results which we know of
in other similar diseases. We know that anyone
who has had the measles or scarlet fever rarely is
again attacked by the same, as a rule he is permanently
proof against them.</p>

<p>In the same way as vaccination protects from
small pox, an injection of Koch's remedy acts
against pulmonary consumption. Koch makes a
cautious statement:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"On the other hand it is possible, from analogy
with other infectious diseases that those who are
once cured become permanently exempt."</p></div>

<p>Koch reaches this result, that beginning phthisis
can with certainty be cured with his remedy. On the
other hand, advanced consumptives, in whose lungs
large cavities already exist, may possibly be improved
but can not be cured. However he provokes
the idea, that perhaps his method of treatment together
with a surgical operation, that removes all
gangrenous matter from the lungs, may yet have
beneficial results in the end. The idea is not entirely
new to treat lung diseases with the aid of surgery;
unfortunately the operations have heretofore been
thought too risky. Perhaps we will now have a new<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_c27" id="Page_c27">[c27]</a></span>
branch in operative technic, surgery of the lungs.
Koch advises to conduct this lung surgery after the
manner of operating empyema. This is an operation
performed in the case of suppurative pleurisy to
remove the pus from the pleural cavity. This operation
has been successfully carried out for a long time.</p>

<p>Koch makes it of especial importance, that
while treating consumption with the new remedy,
the general attendance and nursing is not to be
neglected. Koch also calls attention to what has
been said before, that the general hygienic factors,
good hospital treatment, mountain climate, etc.,
will never be dispensed with, on the contrary will be
indispensible to the furtherance of cure.</p>

<p>In conclusion Koch again remarks that brilliant
results are only promised in the early stages of pulmonary
consumption (phthisis). Physician and
patient must move all levers as to the existence or
non-existence of tuberculous diseases.</p>

<p>Then those daily pictures of extreme wretchedness
from consumption will be a thing of the past.
Then the danger of contagion will be lessened resulting
from the decrease of the number of tuberculous
persons and of the tubercle-bacilli, and perhaps it
will soon be possible to name the day on which with
the last tubercle-bacillus the ravaging pest, tuberculosis,
will be extirpated.</p>
